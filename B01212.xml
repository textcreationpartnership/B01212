         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:180936:9"/>holy assemblies being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, you acknowledge the excellency of those goods which God hath taken from you, and doe lament the inestimable grace with <hi>compassion</hi> and holy <hi>alteration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is that which hath moued me to impart to you what spirituall comforts I can, and indeuour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute something to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage your griefe; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that heauinesse duls the Spirit, &amp; causeth the conceits to bee more drooping; notwithstanding I hope, that God will helpe this want with the aide of his Spirit, and that the
<pb facs="tcp:180936:9"/>defect, which griefe may cause mee, may be suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with affection, and with that cordiall loue, which a faithfull Pastour beares to his flocke.</p>
            <p>For God is my witnesse, how greatly your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sting mee, how many sighes and groanes they plucke out from mee euery houre; how bitter my life is to me since my separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it being impossible for me to put my hand else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where then vpon the sore, and to thinke on any thing else then vpon your affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: it is this griefe that hath moued me to make this draught of consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:180936:10"/>written with teares, and interrupted with sighes; so that euen that which moued me to write, was vnto me a trouble and a hindrance.</p>
            <p>I hope notwithstanding, that you will accept this gift, remembring him whom you haue loued in presence, and who hath serued you the space of two and twenty yeeres, if not with such successe and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency required, at least with much feruour and affection: for the loue which ye haue shewed me, was vnto me an incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; and the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing which God did powre
<pb facs="tcp:180936:10"/>vpon the Ministery of your Pastors, made mee hope, that God would vouchsafe me that fauour, that I might end my daies amongst you, in my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery. Now although that I haue not lost altogether this hope, notwithstanding beholding Gods Church on the brim of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and deepe downefall, and not knowing how it will please God to dispose of you and me; I thought it my duty to speake vnto you once againe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to comfort my selfe, in comforting you; for in drawing out to you these comforts, I haue represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:180936:11"/>to my selfe the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for so many yeeres, in diuiding the Word of God among you, and haue felt a pleasure mixed with griefe, and in my heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse a sweete diuertion.</p>
            <p>Besides that, I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to expose vnto your view these remedies, which I haue had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of, and those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which haue staid me in my afflictions; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which I had wholy fainted, and it had beene impossible for mee to haue ouerliued so many Churches broken downe, and the prosperity of my
<pb facs="tcp:180936:11"/>flocke, from the which I haue found my selfe snatched away in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Gods will was, that the first clap of this thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der should light on my head, and that my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be a fore-runner of yours.</p>
            <p>Wherein notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I acknowledge the prouidence of God, who knowing that my abode amongst you in so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a time, would be a kindling of the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries hatred, and would haue beene an occasion of trouble and persecution on the flocke, hath caused a particular occasion to
<pb facs="tcp:180936:12"/>rise; for the which my fellow labourers in the worke of the Lord haue thought it expedient, that I should yeeld vnto the present necessity; and by absenting my selfe for a time, looke both to your rest, and my safety; for they hoped that God would ere long appease this tempest, and that I should be quickly restored vnto you.</p>
            <p>But it is happened otherwise: for it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to prolong the dayes of affliction, and aggrauate our euils; whereby our sinnes doe make vs acknowledge his
<pb facs="tcp:180936:12"/>Iustice, and the succeeding euents will make vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Wisdome, and feele the profit thereof.</p>
            <p>Amidst this desolation, that which is the most grieuous vnto me, is the fall of some, whom Satan hath snatched away from vs, that had not imployed the time of prosperity, in preparing themselues for aduersity. They haue beene contented to follow Iesus Christ while he distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bread, but they had not the will to follow him, when he calleth them to beare his Crosse after him. And if those instructions which
<pb facs="tcp:180936:13"/>we haue often propounded vnto you, are yet ingraued in your memories, you will not haue forgotten, that often wee haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the vicious, that shortly God would put them to the triall; and that it was a very difficult thing to hope, that those would perseuere in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Gospell, that serue their vanity or belly, which is a bad Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor in the matter of Gods seruice; that those that are weake against vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hardly would they be firme against griefe; that those that are hot in their owne quarrels, would be
<pb facs="tcp:180936:13"/>found effeminate and faint-hearted in Gods quarrell.</p>
            <p>It may be, that some of them casting their eye vpon this booke, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging therein the language of him that hath spoken so long time to them in the Name of the Lord, will feele themselues pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in their hearts, and finding thēelues brought to huskes, and fed with meates that nourish not, will wish for the bread of the Fathers house, and will returne to God. It may be, that others also already standing on the Pinacle, and ready to cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb facs="tcp:180936:14"/>headlong, will be kept backe by the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which we propound in this booke, and will be possessed with a godly feare to saluation, and with a holy astonishment.</p>
            <p>As for those whom the feare of God, and faith in his promises make stedfast against these temptations, they may couple these les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with their holy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and may adde thereunto that, which their study, or griefe, or hope may furnish them with, to make therewith a web of holy thoughts, and a subiect of their ordinary entertainement with God.
<pb facs="tcp:180936:14"/>In which entertainement there is a sweetnesse, which humane reason cannot taste of, and a soueraigne comfort; for it is also the end for the which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth vs of the delights of the world, that wee may seeke our delight in this communication with him.</p>
            <p>To this end wee must aboue all things aske for this Spirit, who is the Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, this Spirit of Peace, this reioycing vnction; for they are not our words that comfort the heart, but the efficacie of Gods Spirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them; without the which we sowe vpon the
<pb facs="tcp:180936:15"/>stone, and tickle the eare, without mouing the heart, and comfort those that haue more neede of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then of comfort.</p>
            <p>It is this Spirit that frames vs to hope against all appearance, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes our spirits to pray without ceasing by a holy obstinacie; Considering that God is our Father, who hath deliuered his Sonne vnto death for vs, who giueth vs his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for a couerture, his Spirit for a guide, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for Gardiens, his Word for instruction, his Kingdome for inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp; the first fruits
<pb facs="tcp:180936:15"/>of his Spirit for an earnest of that Inheritance. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering also, that his Church is his owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, that our Religion is his cause, that his Counsels are hidden, his Wayes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, his Decrees vnauoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, his Iudgements iust and wholsome, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises certaine, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions tender, &amp; his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction immutable; He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth marueilous workes with little meanes, yea without meanes, yea against all meanes, and against all appearance. Let vs not therefore put limits to his power, let vs not controll his Wisedome,
<pb facs="tcp:180936:16"/>nor let vs doubt of his Truth, and of the firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his promises.</p>
            <p>Who knoweth if God sayth not in himselfe, This people is not as yet low enough to be raised vp with miracle? I will bring them to that passe, that their deliuerance shall be a kinde of resurrection; for God, who hath beene dishonoured by vs in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, will make his Name glorious both by chastisements, and by our deliuerance. And if his Fatherly goodnesse wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assemble vs after this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipation; it must be our duty to offer vp to him
<pb facs="tcp:180936:16"/>Sacrifices of thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and to labour with all our power to raise vp the ruines of his Temple. But if he hath otherwise determined, he will shortly gather vs together aboue, and bring vs into his Temple, the stones whereof are liuing, whose builder is God, and foundation Iesus Christ; a Temple which the mutinie of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious people cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage: while that men shall triumph ouer vs here on earth, wee shall triumph with God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; wayting for the time wherein the enemies of God shall appeare before

            </head>
            <p>AS Peace is a thing to be desired: so the Prince that will long enioy it, ought to be prepared for warre. The like is of the Church of God, whose prosperity we ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and pray for the peace of Ierusalem; but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the dayes of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, wee are to be alwayes prepared for aduersity; for seeing that God afflicteth his children to amend
<pb facs="tcp:180936:18"/>them, the right way to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew affliction, is to better our selues before wee be strucken, and preuent his chastisements by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>And if by reason of the sinnes of a part of the flock, it pleaseth God to visit his Church with his rods; they who by continuall prayers, by the contempt of the world, by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Gods Word, by the exercise of good workes, haue kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues ready for the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to come, will haue this aduantage aboue the rest, that they will haue the plaster ready before the blow, and shall not be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished as at a thing not expected; for affliction
<pb facs="tcp:180936:18"/>beats downe onely those whom it surprizeth, and none is ouercome by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity, but hee that hath beene corrupted or lulled asleepe by prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that it hath pleased God, whose coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels are vnsearchable, and iudgement righteous, and whose hand is vnauoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to send vs dayes of weeping and of lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to scatter in his anger those flockes, which he had gathered together in his mercy; it is our part now to apply the remedies, wherewith euery one fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, ought to haue beene prouided before the euill happened; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fitly applied, will serue
<pb facs="tcp:180936:19"/>to make the afflictions not onely lighter, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so profitable, and to extract sweetnesse out of bitternesse, as <hi>Sampson</hi> did, and make that the euill themselues become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
            <p>An enterprize truely full of difficulty, and which Philosophy neuer vndertooke without rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and hath nener ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himselfe without deceit; for in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wee haue it selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to it; and wee are contradicted by humane iudgement, and vulgar opinion.</p>
            <p>The condition of the faithfull is like vnto that of the Planets, that mooue themselues against
<pb facs="tcp:180936:19"/>the course of the world; and to the nature of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fishes, that swim al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes against the streame, and tend towards the spring; for wee are called to goe against the current of customes, and of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like opinions, that wee may tend vnto the spring of life, which is with God: Whose counsels march contrarie to our thoughts; to whom the wisdome of man is meere blindnesse; who from the beginning of the world, hauing drawne the Light out of darkenesse, hath not since ceased to draw good out of euill, and his glory from ignominy it selfe.</p>
            <p>But before wee come to set open to the view, these
<pb facs="tcp:180936:20"/>spirituall comforts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, it is necessary to discerne in a Christian man these two conditions; the one, whereby hee is a man, the other, whereby hee is a Christian, that wee may discerne the euils that doe befall him as hee is a man, and subiect to the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities with other men, from those that befall him as hee is a Christian, and for the profession of the Gospell; for according to the diuersitie of these euils, we must apply the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180936:26"/>but a sore finger, or the tooth-ach makes vs impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. One sole affliction amidst many a good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, troubleth all our ioy, and changeth all our sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into bitternesse. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity is like a long traile of Cannon which stops by the way for want of a peg. Therefore as the tongue beares it selfe towards the payning tooth: so wee speake oftner of a small af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which befals vs, then of many of Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. Yea the pleasures doe incontinently distaste vs, and the greatest delight hath some graines of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and a tune of sighing; as the tickling of the arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, if all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180936:26"/>be well considered, we shall finde that the euils of this life doe farre surpasse the goods, both in number and greatnesse. Then are wee not to maruell, if mans life that is more sensible of euils then of good, and that hath more euils then goods, yea and which changeth his good into euill by the indisposition of his minde, is full of bitternesse. For Gods blessings falling in the lappe of a man destitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Gods Spirit, doe rot, because his heart is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes corrupted; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity ill guided, is more hurtfull then affliction. In a word, man hath a soule that kils his body, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a sword that cuts his scabberd, and that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180936:27"/>himselfe, and cuts to himselfe many a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some businesse.</p>
               <p>Vnto all these euils the Word of God propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth some remedies, and giues wholesome counsels; which if wee follow, wee shall not onely not make worse the euils that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs, but wee shall ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them, yea wee shall make them profitable and wholesome.</p>
               <p>Now seeing there are two sorts of Afflictions, whereof some doe happen indifferently to all men, as sicknesse, losse of parents, losse of goods; but the others are proper vnto the children of God; wee will beginne with the first sort of them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN euils common to all men, the man fearing God, behaues not himselfe after the common fashion, but gouernes himselfe otherwise then other men; for worldly men impute the euils to chance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of mischiefe, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure against God; or if the force of their anguish doe draw from them some words of repentance, or some prayers suggested by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180936:28"/>necessity, so soone as the euill is past, they returne to their naturall disposition; like to hogges that neuer looke towards heauen, but when they are cast to ground and ouerturned; which if they be let goe, returne presently their snowts towards the earth.</p>
               <p>The same Afflictions happening to the faithfull, doe produce other effects. For example, If he be ficke, he will take this Affliction not as common by chance, or onely by naturall causes, but as sent from the hand of his heauenly Father; &amp; acknowledging that it is God that strikes, hee will turne himselfe towards him that hath strucken him, and will say with <hi>Dauid,</hi>

Rather the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian will examine his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the causes, wherefore God afflicts him, to the end he may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God by his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He will acknowledge that hauing abused his health, hee deserues to be sicke; and thereupon hee will in his bed passe ouer his life past, and examine his actions, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:180936:29"/>the graces of God which he hath abused. He will discharge his teares in the bosome of his Father, and will grieue, not for the euill he feeles, but for the euill hee hath done; and will lament his sinnes with teares of repentance. So soone as he feeles himselfe strucken and compelled to be bedrid, in putting off his clothes, he will dispose himselfe as if he did cast off his body, and well put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bed, as ready to be put in his graue, saying in himselfe, Should this well be the houre of my deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?</p>
               <p>And if he be troubled with grieuous paines, to comfort himselfe, he will represent to himselfe those
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180936:29"/>sorrowes infinitly greater, that Christ Iesus hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for vs, and those infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite torments, from which he hath redeemed vs. He will meditate on the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and assurance of the promises of the Gospell, and will comfort himselfe, because his peace is made with God; and will appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the excellency of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall saluation, wherewith the corporall sorrowes of a few dayes are not to be compared, but are as a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pill at the beginning of an euerlasting feast. It will be good also to represent to himselfe, so many holy soules, that either from bed, or from the fiers and Martyrdome, are gone to the Kingdome of heauen;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:180936:30"/>which being arriued at the hauen, continually receiue into their number other soules, beaten with the storme, and tossed by the tempest of this world.</p>
               <p>And if those that are about the sicke, doe weepe, iudging ill of his malady, he will chide them, and tell them, that their sorrow is iniurious to Christ, as if they did presume that it were a losse to goe to him. He will tell them that which Iesus Christ told his Disciples,

               <p>And if he recouers his health, he will receiue it as a gift which God bestowes on him, to imploy it to his seruice more diligently

               <p>Such are the thoughts and words of the man fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, afflicted with sicknesse, which are worth a thousand times more then the merry words at banquets.

               </head>
               <p>THe loue of the goods of this world, is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill deepely rooted in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:180936:33"/>heart of man. It is that which makes a man haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his life, to gaine a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle money, as one that would cast downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his body, to saue his clothes. This is the vice, which makes a man more couetous of gold and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, euen then when his age warnes him that he hath no more neede of it; yea which makes him bemoane the money which shall be spent at his funerals. It is this vice that makes a man serue his riches, in stead that they should serue him and make vse of them, and bee possessed by those goods, in lieu that he should possesse them. It is this that hinders almes-deeds, and quencheth Christian
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:180936:33"/>charity. For as that Land where are Mines of gold and siluer, is ordinarily bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and those mines are a haunt of deuils; so he that is tyed to his gold or sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, becomes barren in good workes, and his heart becomes the habitation of the euill spirit. And if the couetous man doe any good, it is after his death; for he is like to a chest so well shut vp, that none can get any thing out of it, till it be broken vp; and then his money that was priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and kept vniustly, is set at liberty.</p>
               <p>They that are possest with this vice, finde pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vntolerable: and if they happen to leese their goods, they reiect all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:180936:34"/>But the man fearing God; who by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of goods hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to imitate pouerty in the midst of his plenty, and to possesse the things of the world, as not possessing them; when God takes away his goods, hee doth not onely not murmure, but he findes gaine in this losse, and profit in this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and many wholsome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</p>
               <p>First, not to finde his condition miserable, he will set before his eyes Christ Iesus,
<note n="f" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9</note> who though hee was rich, yet for our sakes he became poore, and had not where to lay his head; sanctifying pouerty in his person, and honouring it by his example; and the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:180936:34"/>example of the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that excellent instrument of Gods Spirit, who got his liuing with the labour of his hands; and the example of the other Apostles, whom Iesus Christ sent to preach the Gospell without money and without prouision; hauing told them euen at his first preaching, that
<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</note> Blessed are the poore, yea the poore whom Saint <hi>Iames</hi> sayes
<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.5.</note> are rich in Faith.</p>
               <p>Now GOD hauing brought to pouerty those whom he loues, will haue them take pouerty for a spirituall diet, and an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Christian absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; whereby it pleasech God to discharge them of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:180936:35"/>earthly cares; or abate their pride and vanity, or to make them fitter to carry the Crosse after Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, or oblige them to worke; or to lift vp their hearts towards other goods, the purchase where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is certaine, the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on firme, and the price in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible; that they may labour for goods that cannot bee taken away, which follow the faithfull in exile, enter with them in prison, and which none can depriue him of, euen when he is depriued of this body.</p>
               <p>The faithfull will also acknowledge, that God by pouerty withdrawes him from lewdnesse, keepes him aloofe from tentations,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180936:35"/>and reduceth him to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety; God handling him, as when he sends the gowt to the feet and hands of that person that charged his fingers with diamonds, and carried his too spruce shooes, to reduce him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force to plainenesse. Hee will therefore say in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, God knowes what is profitable for mee; hee knowes that if I were rich, I should waxe insolent; hauing much to distribute, I should haue a greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to make him. As he proposeth to the rich the Crowne of Christian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, so hee layes vp for me a Crowne of patience.

Of so many sheetes whereof the coffers of the rich are full, one alone will suffise to wrap him in after his death. For naked came wee into the world, and naked shall we goe out, and shall carry nothing of all those our goods, but that which wee haue giuen to the poore;

                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 19.17.</note>
                  <hi>For hee that hath pitty vpon the poore, hee len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which nature it selfe teacheth vs. For what care wee whether wee drinke of a great or small brooke, so wee bee satisfied? or whether wee take out of a great or small siluer
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180936:37"/>plate, so we be nourished.</p>
               <p>Whosoeuer weighs well these things, will confesse that the misery of poore folkes consists not in that they are poore, but in that they enuy the rich, and cannot frame themselues vnto pouerty. For wee haue that euill, that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of vertues, we compare our selues with those whom wee thinke are our inferiours, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come presumptuous; but in matter of riches, wee compare our selues with those that surpasse vs, and thereby wee become enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Wee finde occasion of pride in other mens vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and occasion of fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse by other mens riches: in stead that wee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:180936:38"/>should looke at those that are more vertuous then vs, to imitate them; and at those that are poorer then vs, to giue God thankes. So that in matter of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, euery one thinkes himselfe well enough por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but in matter of money, euery one is discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly controll the portions which God hath made; not considering that riches are glewie and a dangerous snare, and a place where Satan spreads his nets, and thornes that often choke the good seed of Gods World.
<note n="o" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9.</note>
                  <hi>They that will be rich, fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtfull lusts, which

For as a Free-man who is simply clothed, will neuer enuy Lackeyes, though co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with imbrodered clothes, and with magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Liueries, because that euen that magnificence is a marke of their bondage: Euen so a man fearing God, brought to a pettie condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will neuer repine at the riches of worldly men, because that by the same riches Satan keepes them in slauery, intangles them in his snares, and trailes them by their couetousnes.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:180936:39"/>
               <p> It pleaseth God to deale thus with his children, to stint them, and to keepe them short, while the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked liue in plenty; doing that, which fathers carefull of the health of their children doe. Euen as in a great house it often happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that the seruants are drunken and make good cheere, while the father of the family diets his sonne, to preuent a sicknesse.</p>
               <p>We haue another euill; that often we call that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, which many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent seruants of God would esteeme plenty. Such a one thinkes himselfe poore, that hath more money then all the Apostles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had, whereof the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thought himselfe rich;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:180936:39"/>for we measure our riches with the ell of our coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, which hath no end; whereas wee should measure them with the ell of Nature, which is short, and contents it selfe with little. And againe, euen of that which nature requires, godlinesse pares off some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times something, when it pleaseth God to reduce his children to passe without many things which are esteemed necessary, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome them to passe the easier without superfluous things.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let vs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Apostles counsell, saying,

                  <hi>he will not sorrow as they that haue no hope;</hi> nor as those which haue obstinate teares, and and an ambitious mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; or as they which would willingly contest against God. Surely hee

We shall goe to our friends, but they shall returne no more to vs; they are not lost, but they are sent before vs, yea I say, that though we could restore them to life by our teares, yet ought wee not to trouble their rest; and to content our desires, cast them againe into those euils, from the which God hath deliuered them. Is it not a great deale better wee should prepare our selues to follow them, then to consume our selues in lamenting them? Is it not better wee should diuert our heauinesse by feare and an holy care, then to make

And thinke ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the good things to come that are certaine, and of an infinite value, then on the euils past, which are petty in comparison of them, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy?</p>
               <p>It will be good also for a man to say in himselfe, God hath taken away a person whom I loued sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, that I may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter transferre my thought to him alone, and that hee alone from henceforth pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse all my loue.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:180936:47"/>which humane wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome propoundeth against euils, are weake, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of those that are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to vs by the Word of God: for Philosophy drawes her consolations from necessity, telling vs, that in vaine wee torment our selues about euils that cannot be remedied. But euen that that they are without remedy, is that which troubleth vs most, and is the greater part of the euill. Shee teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs that our euils are bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without making them more bitter by impatience. In vaine doth man open his arme against the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and it is some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to follow nature, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:180936:47"/>in a generall ruine to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrap himselfe in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. But great euils are not cured by blowing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: and words cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly set forth with arte, may serue to tickle the wound, but not to bring any remedy to it; the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auoidable necessity of euils serues rather to harden the courage, then to comfort the heart, or to giue peace to the conscience. The right comforts are not those which onely frame vs to patience, but those which settle ioy in the heart, and which teach vs to reckon Afflictions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Gods gifts, and to finde matter of thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing in our chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:180936:48"/>
               <p> These counsels and comforts may easily bee put in practice by him, in whom Gods feare hath mortified those burning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and planted in his heart a hatred of vice. For as a sound man, and that hath the noble parts of the body well composed, will easily indure labour, and will quietly sleepe vpon straw; euen so the man that hath a conscience sound, and purged of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, enuy, hatred, and incontinencie, which are indispositions and mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the soule, will finde Afflictions light, and will, vnder this burthen, runne on his race with alacritie: But hee whom ambition puffes vp, pleasure corrupts,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:180936:48"/>whom enuy hath dried vp, whom couetousnesse hath bowed towards the earth, will fall vnder the burthen, and will feele himselfe ouer-whelmed with Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. He who aspiring to high things, is rolled downe from his high hopes, will bite off the bit with choller, and impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare pouerty. But hee who hoped for nothing, nor pretended any thing on earth, as he desired not to gaine much, so will hee not mourne with excesse for that hee hath lost. For though the euils whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our nature is subiect, or which God sends vs, or which men doe vnto vs, are great, and in great number; are notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:180936:49"/>a great deale more tolerable, then those which a man doth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by burning hatred and enuie, by vniust quarrels, by rash ambition, by disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered desires, by an enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fretfulnesse, and by an impatient precipitation; for as those vlcers that came of themselues, are a great deale worser then wounds and hurts, because the euill is inward, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion or constitution of the body helpes: So those euils which a man doth to himselfe by his vices, are more dangerous, and more obstinate against remedies, then those afflictiōs which men inflict on vs, or which God sends vs; because they are euils which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:180936:49"/>expressely, and which are aided by nature; and which hauing weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vs, and softened our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, make vs weake to beare afflictions, and vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to profit by Gods chastisements. Thinke not that hee can beare those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils which his enemies doe to him, that is an enemy to himselfe; or that a man that loues his riches more then God, can patiently indure that God take from him his riches.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ALL those afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we haue spoken of heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, are afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that befall indifferently to all men, as well good as bad: Sauing that God is accustomed to visit oftener
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:180936:50"/>his children with his rods, and keepe them in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall exercise of humility, because hee is carefull of their saluation. Doing as a father, who for the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same fault committed by his sonne, and by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, will chastise his sonne, and will leaue his seruant vnpunished. But in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Treatise we will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speake of afflictions that are proper to the children of God, and which befall them for the profession of the Gospell.</p>
               <p>There is great difference betwixt these two sorts of afflictions. For those hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to vs, as to men weake, or as to sinners; but these, as to Christians, and for Gods cause. Those are an
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:180936:51"/>exercise of patience, these ouer and aboue, are matter of glory. Those are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements which God sends; these are ouer and besides scarfes of our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, honourable markes, conformities with the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Sonne of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle, very well exercised in this warre, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth these afflictions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the free gifts of our God, saying,
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29</note>
                  <hi>For vnto you it is giuen, in the behalfe of Christ, not onely to beleeue on him, but also to suffer for his sake.</hi> Wherefore we seeke comfort against those other afflictions, but these are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a comfort to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; because hee receiues them as testimonies of his heauenly calling, &amp; makes
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:180936:51"/>this conclusion in himselfe, that seeing God fashions him to the sufferings of his Sonne, hee will also fashion him vnto his glory, and that God leades him to the fame end, by the same way.</p>
               <p>To beare these afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is to charge vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the Crosse of Christ, and march after him. For although the man fearing God, beares wifely these other afflictions, and profits by them, notwithstanding the holy Scripture doth not honour them with this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable title of the Crosse of Christ. So <hi>Simon,</hi> a man of Cyrene, bearing the Crosse of Christ Iesus after him, was the image of a Christian. But the two theeues that were nailed to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:180936:52"/>their owne Crosse, bare the punishmēts of their crimes: one of the which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to Christ Iesus, in the extremity of his paines, to the end that those whom God causeth not to beare the Crosse of Christ, and exempts from persecution for the Gospell, may learne by this example to profit in their owne afflictions, and so to beare their owne crosse, that it may serue to conuert them to Christ. But here we speake onely of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which are proper to the faithfull, and which alone may bee tearmed the Crosse of Christ.</p>

                  <hi>that all that will liue godly in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, shall suffer persecution.</hi> Since God hath said that he would put enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the Church hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:180936:53"/>wayes been perfited. Her sufferings haue begun in <hi>Abel,</hi> and will finish at the Day of Iudgement. As soone as God limited his Couenant to the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of two children that hee had, hee that was borne after the flesh, did hate him that was borne after the Spirit. <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> representing two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Nations, struggled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the belly, and their quarrell began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their life. Wherefore the Church makes her complaint,
<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 129.</note> that shee hath beene often afflicted from her youth. Now therefore that shee is come to her old age, can shee hope for any prosperity in this world, seeing that Satan hath not

               <p>Through this way haue passed the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, &amp; all that

The Gospel propounds to vs nothing but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Crosse; and the booke of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation is nothing else but an allegoricall tissue of the combates of the Church of God.

                  <hi>Blessed are they that mourne;</hi> lest that any one imbracing the profession of the Gospell, and promising to himselfe prosperity, finding himselfe deceiued in his calculation, should giue ouer this holy profession: like vnto him who hauing tasted of a tun of excellent good wine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to buy it, hauing heard of the price, hath no mind to it, vnwilling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow

For the Sonne of God will haue a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee resolue himselfe to follow him, to know how much hee must spend, and that euery one make this reckoning by himselfe, Must I put to it the halfe of my goods?

               <p>Not that Iesus Christ willes vs, that without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity we runne headlong into dangers for his sake; but rather he willes vs, that when they

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:180936:57"/>faint-hearted and fearfull, but also it is not angry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her owne life. Then is it time to dye for Iesus Christ, when a man cannot saue his life but by disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and without abating something of that freenesse and liberty that we owe to Gods cause: in that case, the mā fearing God, ought to beleeue, that God will make vse of his blood, for the sealing of the doctrine of the Gospell: then must he, after the example of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> forgoe willingly his garment, to saue his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and willingly strippe himselfe of this body, that he may saue his soule.</p>
               <p>True it is, that God giues sometimes truce to his Church, and, as it were, a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:180936:57"/>day of rest, between two fits of a Feauer, that shee may breath a little, and lest she should sinke vnder the length of oppression.

               <p>And if there bee any faithfull, whom God hath spared and exempted from persecutions, you shall find, that God hath visited him with other trials, and hath not left him without exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise. If hee hath not lost his goods, hee hath possessed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:180936:58"/>them, as not possessing thē, and as being ready to leese them.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:180936:59"/>partake with him in his sufferances. It is iust, and stands with reason, that they haue a part with him in his combates, that will haue a share with him in his victory: that hee that will carry hard by him the Crowne of glory, carry first after him the crowne of thornes: that he drinke first in that cup steeped in gall and vineger, before he drinke of the riuer of his pleasures.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:180936:64"/>that the princes and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple prouoked, imputing these euils to the Gospell, may expell it out of their Country. Which was the cause, why
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.</note> when Iesus Christ came into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Gergesenes; the deuils did cast headlong into the sea the herd of many Swine of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; to the end that the Gergesenes troubled with this losse, might beseech Iesus Christ, that he would depart out of their coasts; which withdrawing of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ will happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all those, that haue more affected their Swine and their temporall commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then the profitable presence of the Sonne of God.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:180936:64"/>
               <p> It is the selfesame spirit, that moued the Iewes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to Gods Word, to say vnto <hi>Ieremy,</hi>

                  <hi>Since wee left off to burne Incense to the Queene of heauen, and to powre out drinke offerings vnto her, wee haue wanted all things, and haue beene consumed by the sword and by the famine;</hi> as if the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the true God, were the cause of the publike ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.</p>
               <p>So the Infidels did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vnto the Christian Religion, the plagues,
<note place="margin">Tertull. Apol.</note> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennesse, and the publike disasters. If the Nyle had not couered their fields, if the Tyber had sweld ouer their wals, if the heauen did stop, if the earth was sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the inraged people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:180936:65"/>that the Christians should be exposed to the Lyons of the Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as sacrifices of expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the saluation of the Common-weale.</p>
               <p>The like hath not beene done to other Religions, though very much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent among themselues. The Romans hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered a Country, brought the gods of the Country prisoners, and led them in triumph. But a little after, they builded Temples to the very same captiue gods. By this meanes an hundred false religions liued toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in peace, euen in one City. Against the sole Christian Religion, the whole world hath beene stirred vp, because It alone
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:180936:65"/>beats downe the Empire of the deuill. Many lies may concurre together, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can vntruth agree with truth.</p>
               <p>So yet euen to this day wee see at Rome whole streetes of Iewes, who hold that Iesus Christ was a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer, and liue in peace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shade of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall seat, and vnder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of him, who stileth himselfe the Vicar of Iesus Christ. The Mahumetans liue also there without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. There are but those that are of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that are not permitted. If any one saith, that the people ought to read the holy Scripture, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand himselfe speaking to God; or if any one saith,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:180936:66"/>that there is no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of our sinnes, then the blood of the Sonne of God; nor no other sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Redemption then his death. If any one saith, that we must not pray vnto the dead, nor adore Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and that to adore Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, wee must lift vp our hearts towards heauen, where hee sits at the right hand of God; and we must not beleeue that God can be made by men; such a man must not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to liue; against such a one all cruelty is too gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and all torments are light. Which is an euident marke of the truth of our Religion, seeing it is most odious to the world, where nothing pleaseth it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:180936:66"/>but that which displeaseth God; and that the Pope of Rome suffering at the feete of his Throne the sworne enemies of Iesus Christ, cannot tolerate our Religion.</p>
               <p>The third Cause of the Afflictions of the Church,
<note n="3" place="margin">Cause, the nature of the Church.</note> is <hi>the nature of the Church it selfe,</hi> and the vices that creepe in by peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity. For euen as the sweet showres causing the corne to grow, causeth also therewith many bad weeds to spring vp; and as the Sunne at the Spring with many faire flowers causeth many sorts of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. So peace restored to the Church after perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, hauing restored vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the preaching of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:180936:67"/>Word, hath also brought many vices.</p>
               <p>After the Massacres which haue diminished vs, and the banishments which haue scattered vs, God had reestablished vs by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent deliuerance; and wee were a miraculous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Gods fauour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of forraine nations, who were rauished in admiration to see, that at the view of a Court, and in the grand Cities of this Kingdome, where our bloud hath beene so often spilt, the Church was set vp againe with luster, and the Gospell preached with such liberty; They said that which is said in the Psalme: <hi>Surely</hi>

               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:180936:67"/>
               <p> But wee hauing nothing wanting to vs, haue beene wanting to our selues, and haue not well acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the time of our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation. For few haue had care to raise vp the ruins of the House of God, but euery one hath beene ready enough to repaire his owne; and addict himselfe to gather goods, in stead of making proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of good workes. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse and insolencie are increased, but godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is diminished. The quarrels haue beene kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and zeale waxe cold. The apparell haue beene sumptuous, and the almse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds sparing. Wee haue bin impatient in our owne iniuries, but little sensible
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:180936:68"/>of the iniuries against Gods honour. In lieu of incouraging mutually one another in the worke of the Lord, wee haue beene enuious one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And though the souldiers made difficulty to teare our Sauiours coat, wee haue made no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to teare his body. By this meanes, besides the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred that our enemies bore vs already, wee haue ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our owne sides to our selues, and wakened the hopes of those that hate vs. In stead of drawing vnto vs the ignorant by our good life, wee haue driuen away the dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, and offended the weake by our euill conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:180936:68"/>
               <p> That generous Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who in the time of our fathers did burne with zeale, and was the stay and ornament of Gods Church; whose vertue supports as yet our vices; which was sober, honest, and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, esteeming that to lose for Iesus Christ was a great gaine; so liberall of her bloud, so sparing of Gods glory; hath left a posterity, who for the most part is not hot, but to pleasure; not couragious, but for quarrels; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse and weake against vices; full of an arrogant ignorance, ready to sell their brethren for a little money, and to turne their backe to God for a morsell of bread.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:180936:69"/>
               <p> The haunting of our Aduersaries hath corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our manners, and wee were scarce distinguished from them, but by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of profession; As if Satan had plucked vp in the night the bounds that separated vs; or as if wee were come forth out of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions to re-enter into vices.</p>
               <p>The reprehensions of faithfull Ministers haue bin ill taken, and some haue beene incensed against them; as if a deformed person brake the looking glasse, in the which it hath seene her deformity. And the Word of God hath not had that ordinarie effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; as if the Spirituall sword had lost his point,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:180936:69"/>or had beene blunted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the hardnesse of hearts; as if the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that God makes by his Prophets concerning the corporall bread, that hee would take away his strength and nutritiue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, were happened to the Spirituall bread of his Word.</p>
               <p>Yea in this present Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, how many shall wee finde amongst vs, that are more offended when the Name of God is blasphemed, then when men doe reuile them? or that beares more impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently his domesticall losses, then the Affliction of the Church? Who is it, that in this calamity apprehends not more the losse of his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:180936:70"/>estate, the confiscation of his land, the breaking of his hous-hold-stuffe, thē to see idolatry set vp againe, and the Kingdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan restored? And who in the Affliction of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, would not easily comfort himselfe, if he were assured to liue in peace in his owne house? Who is it that consecrates his closet, and his houres of solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to holy Meditations, and to powre out his sighs before God, rather then to count his money, and looke to his domesticall affaires? Who is it that endeuoureth not rather to leaue riches to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then to teach them to make vse of them right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to leese them cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:180936:70"/>for the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gospell? And if the feare, and the present perill, and the calamitie that presseth vs doth not range vs in order, what would wee doe in full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity? And when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so ill disposed, and whose zeale is so cold, shall be pressed, and that their turne will bee to suffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others, what can one hope of their perseuerance?</p>
               <p>Some feares are befalne vs since tenne or twelue yeeres, and dangers which at diuers times haue brought vs euen at the doore of persecution. Then did wee fast, and humbled our selues before God, and there was seene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:180936:71"/>But the perill being past, we returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently to our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie dissolutions: quarrels haue beene awakened, and God hath not beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ferued. This Gourd growne vp in a moment, withered a while: after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strucke by the worme of our prophanation.</p>
               <p>Meane while you saw the darkenesse of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thicken, and errour gather strength. In our enemies, superstition was a great deale more feruent, then true Religion in vs. They tooke off, euen to their earings, to melt a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calfe: but wee were niggards in the building of the holy Tabernacle. Their Images were couered: and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:180936:71"/>our poore naked: and their blind deuotion did arraigne our irreuerence. Many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, who haue mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at those that durst not read the Scriptures, for feare of being seduced, haue not cared to read it, or at least by the reading are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better. Many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs haue mocked at those that pray without vnderstanding themselues: but they themselues make their prayer to God, not thinking on that they say, and their gesture witnesseth their want of reuerence. Those are ignorant, but these prophane; those know not what they doe, but these doe not what they know; those erre in the night, but these doe

               <p>There was a time that they testified of our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and did know vs by our plainenesse and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse in clothes, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in our actions, by our mutuall, charity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and because Gods Word was in our mouthes; and said that which the Iewes of the hous-hold of <hi>Caiphas</hi> said vnto <hi>Peter.</hi>

Now it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares why they mockt at Purgatory: it is because they pretend to enter into Paradise with their vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And to what tends this iustification by faith, without workes, but onely that they should not bee bound to do good works? and the confidence &amp; trust in the mercies of God, but onely that they may fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe on this pillow, and plunge themselues into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? By this meanes wee haue beene the cause that Gods holy Name hath bin
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:180936:73"/>blasphemed, and his truth made stinking among men; wee haue hardened the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and giue occasion of scandall to the weake.</p>
               <p>And it is good that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we be taught by our enemies; if perchance those that haue not been moued by the sweetnesse of the voyce of our God, can bee pricked by the sharpnesse of the reproches of those that hate vs. For as one may doubt, which is the better of the two, either to bee faithfully reprooued by his friends, or be praised by his enemies; so is it a thing out of doubt, that the praises of our friends are not so profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to vs, as the blames and reproches of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:180936:73"/>
               <p> But behold wherewith we are to be more astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for such a thing is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falne in the time of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and of rest, that was vnheard of before, and which is not happened in the time of fiers, and in the heate of persecution. For then, if any Minister of Gods Word had reuolted, that had been esteemed a wonder; and hee that had seene him then, would haue suspected his owne eyes, and would haue had much adoe to beleeue it. But these latter yeeres haue produced a number of such examples, and the holy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery hath been possessed by traitors. Bellies are mounted vp in the Pulpit, who for a little money haue
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:180936:74"/>sold their soules to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell; who haue not done so much hurt by their aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, as they had done by their euill life, seeing that in going out, they haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened the body of the Church of an inward plague, as if it had vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a worme, or cast out a filth out of the House of God.</p>
               <p>And if men seeke for the zeale and constancy of our forefathers amongst vs, they shall seeke for that which God findes not there; for they did snatch at the bread of the Word of God from the middest of the flames, and did seeke after it amidst the perils: but we are in distaste with it amidst our plenty. If they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:180936:74"/>were imprisoned for glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God, in the selfe-same prison they glorified God to the double. They ranne to martyrdome, and wee to pleasure, and to couerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. They were more prodigall of their liues, then wee of our money. They suffered more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly for Iesus Christ, then we do speake for him. They increased and edified the Church of God by their good life, which wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy by our peruerse life. And if these faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, who amidst the fires and the persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, haue planted so many Churches with so great and good successe, should rise vp from the dust; they could not know their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:180936:75"/>flockes, and would be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, how in so little time Satan hath made so great a distraction.</p>
               <p>In a word, our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doe resemble the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> whose head was of gold, and the stomake of siluer, and the belly of brasse, and the thighes of iron, and the feet mingled with earth: for the more wee descend, and the worser wee waxe. And as the seuen leane kine that appeared to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> deuoured the seuen fat ones that marched before them: our latter yeeres haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the plenty of the former, and haue brought vs the want of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Thereupon, as the expert
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:180936:75"/>Mariners beholding the foame shaping it selfe on the sea, and the Fowles of the sea retiring themselues by flockes towards the land, doe presage a storme: so the faithfull Ministers of the Gospell, whom God hath established Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ouer his House, seeing this corruption, did presage with a loud voyce, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest to come, and did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see the euill that is befalne vs.</p>
               <p>The euents haue verified our words: they haue been true, to their great griefe, and their threatnings haue beene prophesies against their will. For God in an iustant hath turned away his fauorable countenance; he hath brought the dayes
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:180936:76"/>of weeping, and of anguish, and of desolation: dayes, wherein after the teares drawn dry, remains nought, according to the world, but sorrowfull silence, full of confusion, and an expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of worser things. Dayes, in the which the blood of the faithfull is spilt, and the wilde Bores haue broken vp the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Lords inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; &amp; the remembrance of the seruices of <hi>Ioseph</hi> is lost. Wherein our Townes are sacked, the people num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by the sword, and wee are driuen out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which we haue defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for those that did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell vs. Dayes, wherein the threatnings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are fulfilled, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:180936:76"/>that amidst the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the House of God, should bee heard the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant, and the Owle; and the Satyrs should skip and sport there: that is to say, that the children of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the euill spirits should reioyce amidst the desolation of the Church.</p>
               <p>For God hath said in himselfe, Seeing that this people doth corrupt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in prosperity, wee will see if hee will amend in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity; Seeing that my words haue not mooued them, I will mooue them with paine; Seeing that he hath not heard the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my voyce, he shall feele the waight of my hand. Because we haue bin tyed to our goods, as if wee
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:180936:77"/>were children of this world, God driuing vs from our houses into a strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, makes vs to feele in effect, that we are allies and strangers on earth. Because wee haue not heard the voyce of the afflicted, God hath not heard vs in our affliction: because we haue been so quicke to quarrell, God hath stirred vp a stronger quarrell; that as the burning Feauer dries vp the itch; so the feare of our enemies may smother vp these pettie riots that itch vs. Hee punisheth the distastes of his Word with the want, and the abuse of prosperity with persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He sends a famine not of bread, but of the Word of God, according to the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:180936:77"/>threatning of the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">

               <p>ALthough afflictions, wherewith God vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits his Church, are iust pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that hinders not, but that God drawes from them other wholesome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and diuerts them to another vse. These effects
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:180936:78"/>are either 1. in regard of hypocrites; or 2. in regard of his children that suffer; or 3. in regard of those vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom this example is propounded; of which three kindes of fruits it is needfull to treat in order.</p>
               <p>In the first place.
<note n="1" place="margin">Fruits of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</note> Our God by afflictions is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to cleanse his Church, and to make the hypocrites to goe out of it. He sifts his Church, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the filth from it;
<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.12</note> whose Fan is in his hand, to purge thorowly his floore, that the chaffe and light spirits may be carryed away by the wind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. Those are the waters of triall,

                     <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7.</note> whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God leades men to call them, and retaines for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:180936:79"/>none but such as lappe with their hand of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in passing, and doe not stop for the inioying of the commodities of this life. But hee sends backe those that wallow in them, and giue themselues wholly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to them. Could wee know what true faith is, if there were no hard trials? Could one discerne the true Christians from the hypocrites, if they were not tried in the Cruet of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction? Then it appeares, how much different things they are, to speake and to doe well. Then is knowne the difference betweene faith and carnall security; betweene zeale and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed violence; betweene to be of the true Religion by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:180936:79"/>custome, or by birth; and to be by affection. As <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> said to the mother of our Lord,
<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.35</note>
                  <hi>A sword shall pierce thorow thine owne soule, that the thoughts of many hearts may bee reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> For it is easie to follow Iesus Christ at weddings, or when he giues bread: But to follow him vnto the Crosse, appertaines but to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and to Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and to a few of the faithfull, who burne with zeale, and whom God strengthens with his Spirit. God puts such persons in sight, trying against them the poynt of afflictions. He shakes the tree which hee hath planted, to make that fruit fall, that haue the core tainted; and that adhere
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:180936:80"/>not to the Church of God, but by humane considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not by a firme confidence and assurance in the promises of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell. And it seemes that God will bring foorth a time, wherein none shall perseuere in the profession of the true Religion, but hee that shall haue a faith greater then a graine of Mustard-seed.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, the falles and the reuolts of some, serue to confirme the rest. For obseruing by what meanes Satan hath seduced those that are falne, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd his ambush, and doe withdraw themselues from the place where the pace is slippery, and Satan lies in ambush. They obserue, that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:180936:80"/>this man hath been surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with couetousnesse, that man corrupted by pleasure, that other carried away by haunting the wicked; and thereupon being seazed with an holy feare, and with a trembling to saluation, they implore earnestly the help and assistance of God. And so that sentence of the Sonne of God is verified, who saith, that God
<note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 15.</note> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and lops his Church as a Vine-dresser, that that which remaines may beare more fruit.</p>
               <p>It was neuer otherwise, and it shall bee alwayes so. The Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> thought he remained alone; so great were the reuolts. Many of Iesus Christs Disciples for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooke
<note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.66</note> him, and walked
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:180936:81"/>no more with him. And the Apostle doth foretell, that
<note n="n" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.</note> in the latter times some shall depart from the faith. Can a man wonder if a body that hath voyded much fleame in his youth, doth voyd yet more in his old age? And if the sea that hath alwayes cast much fome and filth on the shore, continues yet to cast it now a dayes? If you say, I but the Church leeseth by these reuolts, and is weakened: I answere, that a body is not weakened in voyding of bad humours, nor a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale in leesing trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: And that peace did corrupt many more, then affliction doth ouerturne. For as one takes more birds with bird-lime, then one
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:180936:81"/>kils with the Peece: so ease belimes more, then perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution beates downe.</p>
               <p>From the very same af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions the children of God gather many fruits.
<note n="2" place="margin">Fruits of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the faithfull that suffer.</note> For God by this meanes keepes them in feare; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes their zeale which languished; pluckes from them the very heart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sighes; drawes teares from their eyes; inflames their prayers by anguish. And if hauing acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the cause of the euill is in them, and that their sinnes haue stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp this tempest, they cast this <hi>Ionas</hi> into the sea; God will appease the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, and will restore to them a calme.</p>
               <p>By this meanes also hee
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:180936:82"/>weanes them from earthly delights; plants in their hearts a contempt of the world; and fashions them to humility and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wherein they haue the Lord Iesus himselfe for example, who, saith the Apostle,
<note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8.</note>
                  <hi>Though hee were a Sonne, yet learned he obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the things which he suffered.</hi> By banishments, he teacheth them that they are strangers in this world. By reproches, hee stirres them vp to seeke their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in Iesus Christ; for if wee had here on earth all things according to our desires, wee should not thinke of our going from hence, and wee would say,
<note n="p" place="margin">

               <p> The very same Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe serue to strengthen the faith of the faithfull; for after this shocke, the faithfull, seeing himselfe standing vpright without hauing staggered, hath a great euidence of his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of the fauour of God, who hath supported him in so great a tentation. So the metals purified and dryed by the fire, are more durable.

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:180936:83"/>So that all being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, it appeares that those that persecute vs, doe serue vs; and that our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are our Physicians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their intention; and these Horse-leeches, or bloud-suckers a-thirst of our bloud doe heale vs. So the King of Assur is termed

                  <hi>the rod of Gods anger,</hi> as sent from God to punish his Church: <hi>Howbeit hee meaneth not so, nor doth his heart thinke so, but it is in heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few:</hi> In ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his owne ambition, hee serues the counfell of God, and the saluation of his children.</p>
               <p>By these same Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, God makes knowne what is the efficacie of his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:180936:83"/>Spirit in those that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to his election: for who is he, that reading the martyrdome of many holy women, doth not admire in a body so weake, so great a force of courage? How comes it that such tender and delicate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who before durst not snuffe a candle with their fingers, haue resolued to cast themselues whole into the fire?

<note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13.</note>
                  <hi>I can doe

               </p>
               <p>Euen as GOD giues stronger rootes to those trees which hee hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the toppe of high rockes, because they are more roughly beaten with the windes; so God giues more force to those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whom he exposeth to rough temptations, and giues faith according to the temptation. Hee puts not out his children to the Combate, to forsake them in their neede; for neither
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:180936:84"/>doe we enter into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict grounded on our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but on his assistance. It is in this extremity, that the Angell of God wipes off the drops of bloud, and Iesus sheweth to the eyes of faith the crowne; and the Spirit of God, who is the comforter, speakes to the heart of Gods children, and kindleth within them a heate that is victorious ouer the heate of the fire. For if God at all times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues the sighes of the faithfull, how much more the last sigh of one of his children, that suffers for his Name? If God gathereth vp their teares, how much more their bloud? If Iesus Christ on the Crosse praied for those that crucified him,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:180936:85"/>how much more will he in his glory make intercession for those, that are crucified for his sake? Surely

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:180936:85"/>the furtherance of the Gospell. So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the Palace, and in all other places; and many of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Lord waxing confident in my bonds, are much more bold to speake the Word without feare.</hi> There is nothing so perswading as the words of a dying man, yea without words his sufferances speake, and perswade more then any preaching; for then all the affections are layd open vnto view, and dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath then no place. The ashes of the Martyrs at all times haue beene the seed of the Church. Neere by these ashes wee warme againe our zeale, which hath taken cold; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:180936:86"/>awakes our faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; for if they doe not serue vs for example, they will serue to accuse vs. Their example will serue vs, if considering their zeale and the greatnesse of their sufferings, wee put our selues in their place, &amp; thinking what wee would doe, if wee were called to the like triall, and if wee are prouided of sufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for so great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <p>The which I say of the death of Martyres, is to be applied also to all those sufferings, by the which the faith of the faithfull is tried and layd open vnto view. For as the drugges doe yeeld more sent when they are stamped in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:180936:86"/>so the faith of the faithfull is of better odour during Affliction.

               <p>THe Word of GOD goes yet further. For in these selfesame persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by the which God chastiseth vs iustly, it findes not onely meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but also matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and to glorie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. So the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that

                  <hi>wee glorie in tribulation;</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the Hebrewes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the faithfull Iewes, for <hi>that</hi>

                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:180936:88"/>And all the Apostles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after they had beene beaten,

               </p>
               <p>One of the principall grounds of this ioy, is to haue in these sufferances Iesus Christ for our Chiefe and companion, and to take part with him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch. For what is there more honourable, then to carrie the Crosse after Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, seeing that in it hee hath triumphed ouer hell, and
<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15.</note> made a shew openly of all the power of the deuill? What greater honour can there be, then to bee made conformable vnto Iesus Christ, and
<note n="e" place="margin">

Those that in times past haue beene prisoners with our Kings taken in battell by the enemies, haue thereby got great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and their memorie is ingrauen in the histories long agoe. How much more is it an honourable thing to be a companion of the sufferings of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Sonne of God, who makes vs partakers of his Afflictions, that hee may make vs partakers of his Kingdome? Truely it is a more honourable thing to suffer with Christ, then to triumph with the world. It
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:180936:89"/>is better to be blamed for Iesus Christ his sake, thē to bee commended without him or against him. It is a greater honour to be inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Booke of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> then to be put in the Chronicles of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For seeing that we haue not life but by the death of Iesus Christ, wee must not thinke that wee can haue any true glory then by his ignominy. And seeing that our life is so short and so miserable, to what more excellent vse can wee imploy it, then to mingle our blood with the blood of the Sonne of God, and subsigne and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie by our death the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospell?</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we not onely

                  <hi>Blessed are yee, when men shall reuile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of euill against you falsely for my sake: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heauen; for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any one be ill lodged and fitted, let him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians did hide themselues in Caues: if his table be ill furnished, let him say, The Apostles had not so much; &amp; this is better worth then the Locusts &amp; the wild ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist.</hi> If hee be put to get his liuing with his hands for the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:180936:93"/>Word of Gods sake; let him remember the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who laboured with his hands, and got his liuing with making of Tents; and let him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade himselfe, that seeing God makes him conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his faithfull seruants in their afflictions, hee will make him conformable to them in that glory which they inioy. Who is it that burnes not with zeale, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the booke of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs? Who is it that feeles not himselfe touched to the quicke, by the example of <hi>Hierome</hi> of Prague, chiding the executioner that would light the fire behind him, and saying, Put the fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, for if I feared the fire, I would not be heere?
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:180936:93"/>Or by the example of that woman, who in the time of <hi>Valens,</hi> ranne with her haire loose about her eares, holding a child in her armes toward the place where the Martyrs were executed; and demanded whither she ran, answered, Crownes are giuen to day, and I will bee partaker of them.</p>
               <p>But that whereunto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ doth principally prepare vs by his aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned words, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure calumnies and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious iniuries for his sake, after the example of the Prophets.

                  <hi>Wee haue found this man a pestilent fellow, and a moouer of sedition.</hi> And that which is the most intolerable, is, that those that put those blames vpon vs, are those that haue their hands dyed in the blood of our Kings; who of fresh memory haue stirred vp the French to rebellion, out of whose schoole are issued the Paricides; and who by expresse bookes burnt in publike by the hand of the executioner, doe teach, that

                  <hi>For to mee to liue is Christ, and to dye is gaine.</hi> To leese this life for the loue of him, is as who should cast off his cloke to saue his life. To suffer for his sake, is as if a mā should cast a few drops of sweat, to gaine a great treasure.</p>
               <p>I confesse indeed, that to vs that are carnall, and tyed to the things present, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions seeme bitter: that it is a hard &amp; offensiue thing to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:180936:99"/>this flesh, to forgoe house, land, friends, to flie into a strange Country. That it is a hard thing to digest, when a man represents to himselfe, that the profession of the Gospell is fit for to share a wallet to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to espouse perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall pouerty. And if God will trie vs further, and call vs to martyrdome, and will haue vs to giue our liues for his Word, then the flesh stirres vp great conflicts, and hath much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe to resolue; seeing that Iesus Christ testifieth euen of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that when he
<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21.18.</note> should be led to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, a nother should gird him and carrie him whither hee would not; and that he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:180936:99"/>haue beene contented to exempt himselfe from this torment, if hee could haue done it without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God. But also it is then when God workes powerfully in the hearts of his seruants; and euen as afflictions doe abound, so doe the comforts abound in greater measure. And God forsakes not his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but makes them feele his secret power, and what is the seale of the Spirit, that white stone, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward witnesse, that earnest of our inheritance; that Spirit of adoption, who speaketh to the hearts of Gods children, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the goods to come as present to him, and giues him in this body a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:180936:100"/>taste of the glory to come.</p>
               <p>Now the comparison betweene the afflictions of the present life and the glory to come,
<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</note> consists, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the continuance; or in the greatnesse and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie. As for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; <hi>Iacob</hi> had already liued an hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres, when hee said
<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.9</note> that the dayes of the yeeres of his pilgrimage had beene few and euill. And God by his Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> speaking of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and captiuity of the Church which should last seuenty yeeres, saith,
<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.8.</note>
                  <hi>For a small moment haue I forsaken thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting kindnesse will I haue
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:180936:100"/>mercie on thee.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though affliction should last the whole life of a man, notwithstanding, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction cannot be long, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that life is short. But God is accustomed to giue some respit and some dayes of refreshing, and to stirre vp some <hi>Simon</hi> of Cyrene, who easeth vs of this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for a while. But the life promised to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is a thing without end. A thousand millions of yeeres make not a part of the eternity, for if at the end of euery million of yeeres the sea should but leese a drop; I say, that at the last it would bee drie, and that there would bee some end in this diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But take from eternity
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:180936:101"/>ten thousand of millions of yeeres, it is not dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed at all, and there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes so much remayning as was before. This word For EVER is a bottomlesse depth, a conceptiō without end, where the thoughts doe leese themselues in the infinitenesse.</p>
               <p>Which makes me often thinke, seeing that this short life drawes after it so great a traine and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and that it is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereon infinitnesse depends; and that the euill which men doe, cannot be amended after the course ended: how it commeth to passe that men leese and languish out needlesse their time, as if they had alwayes more remayning, and liue
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:180936:101"/>without thinking to dye, and dye without hauing had a thought to liue well, and goe out of this world, without knowing why they came into the world, being cast into a sleepe by a profound lethargy in the fruition of present things.</p>
               <p>As for the excellent greatnesse of the heauenly glory,
<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariton in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and excellencie.</note> in comparison of the lightnesse of affliction; it is a thing wherein we finde our selues much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and our words are much beneath our thoghts, and our thoughts much below the truth. For God measures not his gifts according to the capacity of our thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, but according to the greatnesse of his riches
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:180936:102"/>and his bounty. And if the Apostle speaking of the doctrine of the Gospell, saith, that they are things <hi>that eye hath not seene,</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</note>
                  <hi>nor eare heard, neither haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heart of man:</hi> How much more doth the fulfilling of these things, surpasse the capacity of our vnderstanding? If the Apostle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hauing seene Iesus Christ trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, was in such wise rauished; how much more would hee haue beene ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished, if hee himselfe had beene transfigured; as our bodies shall be in the day, wherein the Lord
<note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21</note>
                  <hi>shall change our vile body, that it may bee fashioned like vnto his glorious body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fathers naming the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:180936:102"/>death of the faithfull, <hi>a birth,</hi> and the day of their martyrdome, <hi>the day of their natiuitie;</hi> did shew how much esteeme they did make of the life to come; excellent and glorious in comparison of this present life. And such difference as there is betwixt the life of a childe in his mothers belly, and the life of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, that leads an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, or gouernes a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale; such a one, yea greater is the difference bewixt the life of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in this body, and the life which hee shall enioy in the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And such a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as there is of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted darkenesse of the wombe where the childe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:180936:103"/>moues it selfe, with the brightnesse of the Sunne; such is the comparison of the brightnesse of the Sun which wee enioy in this body, with the brightnesse of Gods presence, which wee shall enioy in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly glory. That such a comparison as there is of the narrow place where the childe is shut vp, with this space of the earth, wheron wee walke; such is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the earth, and the out-stretcht cope of the Kingdome of heauen; and as the childe comming into the world, comes forth out of darkenesse, and leauing the secondine that wraps him in, enters into the light; so the soule going
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:180936:103"/>forth out of this body, as out of an obscure prison, leauing this body, enters in the light of God: and that as a child, if it had the vse of reason, would rather laugh, seeing that hee is come out of an infectious and darke place, to inioy the light of the Sunne, in stead that it cries at his comming into the world. Euen so a man laments when he must dye; but if hee knew what this light is, whereinto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enter by death, he would reioyce at the going out of this body, in stead of being sorrowfull.</p>
               <p>In this life our delight is to change places, apparell, and food, and to see, or to doe some new thing; but there our felicity will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:180936:104"/>in rest, and in not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for euer our occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; in being alwaies ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to one action, which we can neuer change with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out losse.</p>
               <p>Here our soules are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted with a thousand and a thousand diuers acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, occupied in making the heart, and the arteries, and the panting veines to beat, to puffe vp the lungs, to digest and distribute the food, to receiue the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fiue senses, to reuolue a thousand thoghts, to hold the bridle of affections, and to make it act a thousand se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall matters at one time. But there our soules wil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire themselues, to see thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues disburthened of all this toyle in a moment; and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:180936:104"/>to enioy a peace without trouble, a happinesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out measure, a contentment without interruption, a good that satisfies all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and excludes all feare.</p>
               <p>There not onely shall bee no more vices nor paine, but also the most part of vertues shall bee no more, because they are rather remedies vnto vices, and a supply against our infirmities. Faith shall be no more, for we shall haue the sight. Nor hope, for wee shall inioy the things hoped for. Nor patience, for there shall be no more paine. Nor continency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there shall bee no more temptation. Nor mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, for there shall be no more misery. The onely
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:180936:105"/>knowledge of God shall fill vp our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and the alone loue of God shall possesse our affections.</p>
               <p>Those that haue the knowledge of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and liue in a Country where idolatry reignes, and where it is not permitted to gather together to serue God; if they happen to passe thorow a Country, where there is liberty of conscience; then finding themselues in the great as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of the faithfull, where the Gospell is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached; they admire the good hap of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that enioyes the Word of God in such plenty. How much more thinke ye, that those soules which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:180936:105"/>God hath gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen, are rauished with ioy; when after hauing so long heard the Name of God blasphemed on earth, and his couenant propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; they finde themselues in the assemblies of the happy Spirits, and mixe themselues with the Saints and Angels;
<note n="k" place="margin">

               <p>But how much greater shall the contentment be, to see Iesus Christ, and to visit him so neere, who is come to visit vs from so

               <p>But the fulnesse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and of glory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in seeing the face of God, as it is said,

                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:180936:106"/>It is a face that is all eye, a face that transformes into his likenesse those that doe behold him, as a looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse exposed to the Sun, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,

                  <hi>They that looke vnto him, are lightened;</hi> God fils them with light and perfection by the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames of his face, and by the irradiation of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. Hee causeth them not onely to see his light, but he makes them also to be light. Hee makes them to see his Brightnesse, not as wee see the brightnesse of the Sunne by two little windowes, which wee call eyes; but as if a man were eye thorowout all his

               <p>And who could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue things worthy of this sight; seeing that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Sunne, which is but darkenesse in comparison of it, dazles our sight? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe, at the signes of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to this glorious view, said,

Seeing that the Seraphins that stand before the Throne, couer their faces with their wings, not able to endure the brightnesse of his Maiestie? Therefore wee put our finger on our mouth, and adore with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:180936:107"/>that which wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expresse with words.</p>
               <p>Then shall we draw out of the wel-spring of goods. Then God will wipe all our teares. Then God will be all in all, that is to say, that by the fruition of this one good, hee will make vs enioy all kindes of good, and by on good thing will satisfie vs in all that we can desire. The number of ioynt-heires shall not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the portion of any one; for heauenly goods are possessed solidly and by parts vndiuideable; no lesse then euery one enioyeth the whole light of the Sun. As formerly <hi>Ionathan</hi> had his strength, and his eyes enlightened, as soone as he had tasted of the hony

               <p>It may be that there are many, who for the seruice they doe to God, would bee well contented that God would reward them with temporall riches and blessings.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:180936:113"/>that the Church of God can euer be wholly abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the world; seeing that the world is but made for the Church of God. It will neuer happen that the Sunne will rise to light on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the enemies of God, and for to serue onely as a lampe in a temple of idols. But then hee will leese his light, and the heauens will fall, when there shall be no more of Gods children to be borne, and that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Elect bee fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Remember the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed ages, wherein the Church of God beaten downe, and ready to giue vp the ghost, set her selfe on foot againe, and became suddenly dreadfull to her enemies. Like vnto a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:180936:114"/>ship that defies the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, &amp; which was thought often to bee drowned, and which is seene againe to appeare amidst the waues, against all hope: for there within is a Pilot that is Master of the winds, and who seemes now to sleepe; but he will awake himselfe, and chide the windes that blow on those waters, on the which the great whore sits, and will giue againe a calme. Remember also the ages of old, in the which the great and potent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires are falne, but the Church remaines on foot amidst the ruines: euen as after a boysterous wind of many dayes, you finde the great Okes broken and cast to the ground, but the Time

And if Satan could ouerturne the heauens, hee had long agoe turned them vpside downe, for he is an enemy of Gods workes: but hee cannot, because that the heauens are vpheld by the Word of Gods power; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Church of God is vpheld by a firmer word; to wit, by the Word of his Couenant in Iesus Christ, whereof it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,

                  </note> that for the sinnes of a Nation, and for to execute his counsell, touching the election and reprobation of men, God sometimes takes away his Church out of a Countrey,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:180936:115"/>and transports this Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke, to carry it into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countrey, and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation that will bring forth better fruits. For the sinnes and crimes of the Churches of Greece, and of Asia, God suffered Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetisme to raigne there; and for the vices of the Westerne Churches, hee hath suffered the sonne of perdition to set vp his throne there. And we know not what the counsels of God are for the time to come. But when such a thing happens, we must not thinke that God doth it onely to punish his Church, for the greater part of the punishment lights on his enemies, and on a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nation that hath long
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:180936:116"/>time resisted his Word. Seeing therefore that this Kingdome is since so many yeeres imbrued with the blood of the faithfull; and seeing that the French Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion since so long time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the Gospel, and doth wilfully oppose himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth by a wilfull blindnesse: Is it not reason that God remoue from that people his Word, and take away from them the means of their conuersion? Is it not reason that God powre vpon such a stiffe-necked Nation darkenesse thicker then euer before, and that it be plunged more then euer before in errour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled to idolatry? When <hi>Lot</hi> was compelled to goe out of Sodom, and to lose

               <p>Let the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the God of all consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather punish vs with any other punishment in this life, then by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vs his Word. Let him leade vs thorow the hideous Desarts; let him cause vs to passe amidst the rolling waues, and thorow fiery Serpents, so that hee causeth to raine on vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the Manna of his Word, and that Bread of heauen, vntill wee come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inheritance which he hath promised vs; and that whilome the thundring voyce of the Lord breakes the Cedars, and maketh the Desart and Liban to

That it will please him to let yet his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle to remaine in this Shiloh, and soften rather the hearts of those that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vs; and not suffer that the seeds of his knowledge that are in many weake soules, which the hardnesse of time hinders from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting themselues, come to be altogether choked by an oppression without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery.

               <p>But who can expresse the sweetnesse of the prayer of the faithfull, and of his secret and solitarie consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and communication with God? For seeing that a man in powring out his griefes into the bosome of his friend, findes himselfe eased, although hee can finde no remedie to it: How much more in disburde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himselfe on God by feruent and familiar pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, seeing it is he that can, that will, and that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to apply remedies

               </head>
               <p>THe Comforts aboue specified, may serue for counsels during afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For whosoeuer shall haue a taste of them, shall haue a great helpe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance. Besides the which, behold yet some more Counsels, which Christian piety and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:180936:126"/>doe minister vnto vs.</p>
               <p>The principall counsell and the most wholesome of all, is, to eschew vices, and to giue ones selfe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, honesty, and a good conscience. The first vice that one hath to fight withall, is couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; for it is that vice which resists most a mans courage and Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie, &amp; which frameth it selfe least vnto the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Gospell in time of persecution: Because it is a trembling vice which doth mistrust euery thing, which thinkes that euery one spies out his money. Loade a valiant man with crownes, and hee will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently be come fearefull and apprehensiue; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:180936:127"/>so faint-hearted, as a man that puts his trust in his riches. It is an impatient vice, which makes a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man thinke that one flayeth him, when one doth vnclothe him, and that one taketh from him his life, when one taketh away from him his money, and that hee leeseth all that hee gaines not. It is a vice, that makes that the couetous man is content to serue God, so that he haue first a pawne in his hands for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter security, as those that plead, hauing the morgage in their hand. He will well beleeue in Iesus Christ, but by the benefit of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentory, and without char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himselfe with any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity. How can it
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:180936:127"/>possible be, that a man thirsting after money, and that placeth all his delight in his riches, can resolue with himselfe to carry all naked the crosse, and to leese all in one day for the profession of the Gospell?</p>
               <p>By that, corruption is entred amongst vs, and that prodigious disloyalty, whereby the salable soules in selling themselues for money, haue sold the life and liberty of those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the protection of which was committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. From thence come those reuolts, and that shamefull forsaking which is seene in many: for as the Apostle saith, <hi>The</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10.</note>
                  <hi>loue of money is the roote of all euill, which while some
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:180936:128"/>coueted after, they haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the faith, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themselues thorow with many sorrowes.</hi> Of the number of those was <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> of whom the Apostle complaineth, saying,
<note n="r" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</note>
                  <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas hath forsaken mee, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing loued this present world.</hi> Euen as the Rauen sent forth of the Arke, a figure of the Church, returned not againe vnto the Arke any more, because hee found some carrion whereon hee lighted. So many hauing taken the flight out of the Church, returne no more vnto it, because they haue found a prey, and receiued some wages of vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</p>
               <p>The same is of other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the which whosoeuer
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:180936:128"/>hath not tamed, will finde himselfe vncapable to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the Crosse of Christ. For a proud man will haue much adoe to indure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and reproch for Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and see him brought to a base conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The heate of quarrels, and the heate of the zeale of the House of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dwell together. Euen as wee see by experience, that the refiners of the point of honour, that are subtill to forme a quarrell ordinarily, flinch away co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in a good cause; and that he that is quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some in time of peace, is commonly faint-hearted in warre; so euery riotous and hot fellow in his owne quarrell, will be found cold
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:180936:129"/>and fainting in Gods quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and the defence of the Church; like vnto horses that are impatient with flies, but hard to the spurre.</p>
               <p>The same we say of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, of gluttony, and drunkennesse, and curiosity to serue this body. For it is not credible that a glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton or a drunkard will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly for the Word of God be brought to bread and water in prison, or in a strange Country. That a Libertine will easily suffer captiuity. That a man sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with ease, can bee firme against griefe. That a woman, which by dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse cannot indure the Sun, can resolue with her selfe to indure the fire.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:180936:129"/>
               <p> In a word, as they who by purges haue emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied their bodies of bad humours, are afterwards more fit to labour; so if by the Meditation of the Word of God, which is a spirituall purgation, and by the Spirit of his feare ye cleanse your hearts of euill desires, you will feele your selues strong to carrie the Crosse of Christ. A man must mortifie his flesh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death come, that hee may die willingly with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, dye first vnto sinne, and crucifie his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence. Which hee must accustome betimes to make it to bee silent, lest that when hee is to resolue himselfe to persecution, it intrude not it selfe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:180936:130"/>to tell her minde, and diuert our resolution.</p>
               <p>If vnder colour of good will it comes to vs, to warne vs to thinke and consider of our life, and our honour, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of our family; wee must chide it roughly, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               </head>
               <p>THat wee may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beare the Crosse of Christ, it is no lesse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to cast off a certaine euill shame, which is to be found in many, whereby euen in peace, and out of persecution, and among our friends, we are ashamed to speake of God and of his Word, in stead that wee should take greedily hold of occasiōs of glorifying God, and defending his cause. Can a man hope that you would speake couragiously for Gods cause before a fire, or a criminall Iudge, if you dare not doe it among
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:180936:131"/>your friends, and for the cause of God? Shall we be ashamed to speake for him, that was not ashamed to dye for vs? Shall we refuse our tongues to him, that hath not refused vs his Kingdome? Or shall wee dissemble a thing, that alone ought to be our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and a perpetuall subiect of thankesgiuing?</p>
               <p>Some excuse themselues on the feare of men whom they feare to offend, and to bee importunate to them. But this feare is wicked, this discretion is vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and iniurious towards God; seeing that for feare to displease men, they feare not to displease God; and despise that sentence of the Sonne of God, declaring
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:180936:131"/>vnto vs, that
<note n="u" place="margin">

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>A third counsell is, to haue an abridgement of Popery.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is also a counsel which helpes much our perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, to consider well the greatnesse of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and darknesse of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and to haue an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement, and as it were a short table, which may represent vnto vs to the life, the face of the Church of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:180936:132"/>Rome; where is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted daily another sacrifice of expiation for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of soules, then the death of our Sauiour Iesus Christ. Where the communion of the Cup, so expresly commanded in the Word of God, is taken away from the people. Where the reading of the holy Scriptures is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as if the Word of God were a dangerous Booke. Where the poore people prayeth to God, not vnderstanding himselfe, &amp; is present at a seruice which hee vnderstandeth not. Where they worship Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of stone and of wood. Where God himselfe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in stones and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Where they adore the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:180936:132"/>bones of the dead, and their reliques. Where men doe vaunt that they can make God with words, and can giue God to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though they cannot giue them saluation. Where there is another purgation of our sins, then the blood of Iesus Christ. Where they will haue God burne the soules of his children in a fire of many ages, for faults remitted, and for sinnes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready pardoned, and for the which Iesus Christ hath fully satisfied; and that not for to amend them, but to content himselfe, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his owne iustice. Where they teach, that the death of our Sauiour exempteth vs not from the satisfactory punishment due vnto our
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:180936:133"/>sinnes committed since Baptisme. Where a man rules, who in his decrees &amp; counsels is called GOD, and, The Diuine Maiesty; who placeth the Crosse at his feet, and vaunts that hee cannot erre in the faith; and distributes vnto men the super-abounding satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of Saints and Monkes, which he saith hee hath in his treasure. And hauing heaped together ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches surpassing the riches of Kings, hee boasteth to bee the successor to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in quality and title of the head of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any one word out of the Word of God, that speakes of this succession. Where they teach, that a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:180936:133"/>man cannot onely fulfill the Law, but also make workes of supererogation more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more perfect then those which God hath commanded. Where mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is forbidden, and the Stewes open, especially at Rome, and in the sight of the Pope, and that by his permission. Where they hold, that man is iustified by his works, which bindes them to teach, that a man cannot bee assured of his saluation. Whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth that men dye with terrour, and would be quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of it, on condition they might bee rosted fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres in the fire of Purgatory, which they say is seuen times hotter then our ordinary fire. Where
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:180936:134"/>the trafficke of Pardons is publike, and where they do no particular seruice for the soule of a man that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen nothing to the Church. Where they aske of God saluation, not onely by the intercession of Saints, but also by their merits. Where they call vpon creatures that know not the hearts, and Saints whom the Pope hath made Saints; yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fabulous saints, and those that neuer were in the world; for the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of which things they haue found an vnwritten word. And the Church of Rome hath made it selfe a soueraigne Iudge in all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and matters of faith; yea, in questions where question is of the duty of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:180936:134"/>the Church, and of her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, so that it is both Iudge and party, and iudge of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Euery man fearing God, will behold these things with an horrour mixt with compassion; and consider with griefe, millions of people, whom the prince of this world hath blinded, and drags (their eyes being bound) into perdition, tyed by custome &amp; a trembling superstition: And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on turning his eyes on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, will admire the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar grace that God hath done him, that hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne him from that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous cliffe and steepe downe-fall, by inlightning his eyes with his Word, and deliuering him from
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:180936:135"/>so horrible a slauery; not for his owne merits, but to make him an example of his grace. Like vnto him that from the top of a Mountain beholds a flood, and a great ouerflowing of a big swolne riuer, that trailes along men, cattell, and houses, and carries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in one day the worke of many ages; by which violent irruption himselfe being carryed away, saues himselfe with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
               <p>This thought will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the courage of a man fearing God, and make him to take a holy resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to say in himselfe, Should I be so miserable, as to forget and neglect those inestimable graces, which
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:180936:135"/>I haue receiued from my God? Should I for so short a life and so miserable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from the way of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall saluation? Should I come to plunge my selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in this mire, and in lamenting the Garlike and Onions of Egypt shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, turne backe by a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of my desires, and turne my backe to God, and breake my promise with him, and offend the Church in her oppression, and ranke my selfe with those that persecute her? Let the earth sinke vnder me, and let men try against me all their cruelty, before any so wicked a thought rise in my mind, or that I giue eare neuer so little to such a dangerous tentation.</p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:180936:136"/>
               <p> It were surely to purchase dearely a few yeeres of a miserable life, as to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase them with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the profession of the Gospell, and with a continuall torment of the conscience, and with the losse of ones saluation: for the remnant of life after it, is a continuall anguish, and a torture of the conscience. How can hee after that, lift vp his eyes to God, whom hee hath denied and abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? How can hee hope for eternall life of him, whom he hath renounced for this temporall life, and hauing beene inrolled by Iesus Christ, in the list and cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of souldiers, how can he hope for the pay which is giuen to none but such
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:180936:136"/>that haue faithfully fought? Then to a faint-hearted and disloyall man, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the time comes in his minde, wherein hee glorified God in the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the faithfull, hee sets before his eyes the Martyrs, whose company hee hath abandoned, which hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to keepe. Each day of his life after his reuolt, will be a new torment: for hee will consider, that his life henceforth serues for nought but to dishonour God, and that euery step that hee makes, is a crime and a scandall, and an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation against the Church of God. The right time to dye is when that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines of our life, serues no more to glorifie God: how
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:180936:137"/>much more when it waxeth hurtfull, and serues onely to the defamation of the truth of the Gospell?

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>A fourth counsell, Continuall Prayer.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw that these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels may profit vs, it is necessary to be earnest with God by continuall prayers, and after the example of <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">
                     <hi>Genes.</hi> 32.26.</note> not to let him go, before he hath giuen vs his blessing; saying with <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob</hi> 13.15</note>
                  <hi>Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.</hi> This obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is acceptable vnto him, hee takes pleasure to bee thus importuned and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. By the delaying of his helpe, hee kindleth our prayers, and sharpens our faith. Thus our Sauiour did put backe twice
<note n="b" place="margin">

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:180936:138"/>third time he gaue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her faith, and grants her her request. And if that wicked Iudge did right to the Widow, ouercome by her importunity,

                  <hi>Shall not God auenge his owne elect, which cry day and night vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, though hee beare long with them? I tell you, that he will auenge them speedily.</hi> And if <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued
<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18.</note> in hope, against hope; hath hoped against all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of hoping well: Why we hauing so many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God, and so many trials of his succour; should wee not hope in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our God, although hee seemeth to giue way to the ruining of his Church; and demolish himselfe in his anger that, which hee
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:180936:139"/>hath builded in our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers time with so many wonders?</p>
               <p>Therefore let vs not bee aweary to cry vnto God, and let vs not faint vnder the length of affliction.

                  <hi>Stand still, and behold the saluation of the Lord;</hi> and know, that these violent indeuours, which Satan doth in these last times, are a proofe that his time is neere, and that hee feeleth himselfe prest with the approching Iudgement of God. You therefore that feare God, bee not weary, but cry strongly vnto God; and as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith,
<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Esa.</hi> 62.6, 7.</note>
                  <hi>Ye that make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord, keepe not si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and giue him no rest,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:180936:139"/>till he establish, and till hee make Ierusalem a praise in the earth.</hi> And thereupon God permits, not only that we presse him with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall prayers, but also that wee forme our complaints with an holy liberty; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O God, seeing it is thy cause, why sufferest thou thine enemies to haue the vpper hand? Art thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weary to bee serued, and to be called vpon by vs? Wilt thou that Satan rule abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and that the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of ignorance couer againe the face of the earth? Hast thou builded so many Churches with the blood of thy Martyrs, and by the preaching of the Gospell, to vndoe now that which thou hast done, and thy
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:180936:140"/>selfe to dissolue thine owne worke? Wherefore shouldst thou permit thy glory to be set at nought, and thy holy Name to bee blasphemed, without punishment, and that our enemies doe aske, Where is now your God? O God, holy and true, where are thy promises and thy zeale? Where thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient compassions, and the sounding of thy fatherly affections? Is thine arme shortened, or thine eares stopt vnto our prayers, or thine eye shut, that thou seest not the wrong and outrage done vnto thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the dissipation of thy poore people? And why hast thou not taken away my soule from this body, before it see this desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:180936:140"/>Why was thy will that I should outliue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of thy Church? O Lord, hearken vnderstand, pardon, looke downe from thy habitation. Turne thy selfe to vs, and we shall bee turned; <hi>Lord Iesus, stay with vs, for the night beginneth to come,</hi> and the darkenesse of ignorance doth much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. Yea, as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> saith,
<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.4.</note>
                  <hi>The day goeth away, and the shadowes of the euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are stretched out.</hi> God takes pleasure in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, so it bee without murmuring, and when it is set forth to our griefe, or to aske for instruction. Thus the Prophets spake, as the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1.</note>
                  <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous art thou, O Lord, when I pleade with thee, yet let mee
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:180936:141"/>talke with thee of thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper, wherefore are they all happy that deale very trecherously?</hi> And in the 89. Psalme, there are many complaints, as if God had failed of his promises, or broken his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant. And the Prophets with a holy priuate familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, doe set before him his promises, his Couenant, the fore-past deliuerances, the oppression of the innocent, the blaspheming of his great Name, and the iniury done to his glory.

            <head>A Prayer and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> Soule, <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the present Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of the Church.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>O Lord, our good God and Father, wee thy poore creatures hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before thy face, dare present our selues before thy holy and high Maiesty, although wee are nothing but dust and ashes. Thou dwellest in the light which no man can approch vnto; but we are by nature plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in darkenesse. Thou
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:180936:143"/>art a consuming fire, but we are as the stubble. Thou art a soueraigne Iustice, and we are poore sinners. Thou art the Spring of life, and we are naturally in death.</p>
            <p>No withstanding (O Lord) thou hast comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to call vpon thee in our necessities, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that thou wilt heare vs. And thou hast giuen vs thy owne Son for a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, promising vs to giue vs all things which we shal aske of thee in his Name. Thou hast called vs to an holy vocation, and amidst the thicke clouds of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance wherewith the earth was couered: thou hast en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened vs with thy knowledge, and admitted vs to be of the number of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:180936:143"/>thy children. Euen euery one of vs a-part hath felt thy particular assistance, and thy Fatherly helpe in the whole course of his life.</p>
            <p>But (O Lord) the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy graces are towards vs, the more guilty are we of ingratitude. For wee haue abused thy gifts, and thy feare hath not beene before our eyes. We haue despised thy Word, and haue not had it in reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. After the fires and Massacres, whereof we are a remnant, and as it were a brand pluckt out of the fire, thou hast restored vs, and hast giuen vs dayes of peace and of refreshing. But wee haue abused this rest, and haue turned it into
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:180936:144"/>licenciousnesse and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute behauiour. Wee haue had more care to repaire our houses, then to set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thine. We haue run after the profit and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this world. In stead of couering the poore, we haue clothed our bodies sumptuously. Wee haue torne one another with quarrels, and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and thereby are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come contemptible to our aduersaries. Our prayers haue beene cold, our zeale fainting, our almes sparing; and because iniquity hath abounded, the loue of many hath waxed cold. In stead of drawing the ignorant to the knowledge of thee by our good life, wee haue offended them, and frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:180936:144"/>them by our euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation. When we haue had strength and humane meanes, and when thou hast brought vp and raised vp amongst vs Princes and Potentates, which seemed to haue beene a firme prop vnto the Church, and a sure retreat during the tempest; Wee haue rested on the arme of the flesh, in lieu that wee should haue put our trust in thee onely, God, who bringest low the pride of the haughtiest, and raisest vp the poore out of the dust, raisest vp and bringest downe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and rankes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hast thou also brought vs downe, and humbled vs, and made vs know the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our thoughts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:180936:145"/>to thy Counsels. Yea euen the Ministers and Preachers of thy Word haue failed in their charges, and in many places the euill and profanation is issued from the prophets. And truely in these yeeres of peace, the reuolt and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie of many that haue had the leading of thy flocke hath beene seene. For these causes (O Lord God) iust Iudge, thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is inflamed against thy people, being confounded in our selues, wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that thy chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are iust. Yea, Lord, a great deale lesser then wee haue deserued. Thou hast couered our faces with confusion; thou hast cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vs with bitternesse;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:180936:145"/>Thou hast made vs drinke of the cup of thine anger. Thou hast called to wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, to mourning, to sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and to ashes; Thou hast lifted vp the hand of our aduersaries, and hast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vs to reproch, &amp; hast made heauy thy hand vpon vs. Thou hast pluckt vp the plants which thou hadst planted, and cast to the ground those Churches which thou haddest set vp by the bloud of thy Martyrs, and by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell. Thou hast broken vp the hedge of thy prouidence, which inclosed thy Church, and hast exposed it for a prey vnto the sauage beasts. And now (Lord) wee see, that in those places where thy
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:180936:146"/>Gospell was purely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, lyes doe now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound, and idolatry is re-established; and the enemies of thy truth doe insolently triumph and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult ouer the ruines of thy House.</p>
            <p>Thereupon we haue cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thee, but thou hast turned away thy face. Thou hast couered thy selfe with a cloud, that our Prayer should not passe to thee; and wee see as yet thy hand lifted vp to strike vs more roughly, and thy rods prepared which thou displayest in thine anger. O Lord God, to thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth righteousnesse, but to vs confusion of face. We acknowledge in all that which is befalne, the tokens
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:180936:146"/>of thy iust anger, and there is no euill in a City, but the Lord hath done it.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, thou art our Creator, and wee are the workes of thy hands; Thou art our God, and wee are thy people. Thou art our Redeemer, and wee are thine owne purchase, which thou hast purchased vnto thee with a great price; a people whom thou hast honoured with thy knowledge. Thou art a mercifull God, and of great gentlenesse, slow to anger, and that keepest it not for euer; that takest no pleasure to destroy thy worke. It is of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that some of vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as yet. It is of thy compassion, that wee are
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:180936:147"/>not altogether consumed. Thou dwellest in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est heauens, and in the most humblest hearts. A broken spirit and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart is an acceptable sacrifice vnto thee.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, O God, heare vs from the place of the Sanctuary, namely, from heauen. Hearken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the prayer of thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and accept their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. Pardon, Lord, pardon the iniquity of thy children for thine owne sake, for the greater it is, the more admirable is thy goodnesse to pardon it. The greatnesse of our sins serues to exalt thy mercie; besides thou hast receiued a sufficient ransome from thine owne Sonne, and a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:180936:147"/>Redemption of infinite price; whereupon wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, dare draw neere vnto the Throne of thy Grace, to obtaine grace and mercie in an acceptable time.</p>
            <p>For, O God, in these perplexities wee see no meanes here on earth; but our eyes are towards thee. Heare vs therefore from thine habitation, and looke downe, for thou art mighty to raise vs vp. Thou art not a God that is onely a God at hand, and not a God a farre off; when hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane meanes doe faile, it is then that thou displayest thy vertue, and then when we by our imprudence doe procure euils to our selues, thou makest vse of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:180936:148"/>for our good; that the subsisting of thy Church be not a worke of the wisdome of men, but of thy holy prouidence. It is thou that in time past hast helped thy people, and brought them out of the yron furnace with a strong hand and an out-stretched arme; that hast carried them as on the wings of an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; that euen in our dayes hast made vs feele thy helpe by many deliueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that hast deliuered our fathers from many rough persecutions, hauing made them to passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row trials more grieuous then this is. Thy compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are not exhausted, thy arme not shortened, nor thine eare heauie; but they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:180936:148"/>are our iniquities that make a separation between thee and vs, which thou wilt take away by thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and by the intercession of our Lord Iesus Christ. It is thou that hast crushed the dragon, and bruised the head of the old serpent, and by the bloud of the couenant hast drawne vs out of the dungeon where there was no water, hauing ouercomne hell by the death of thy Sonne. Thou therefore, great God, that hast snatched vs out of the tallons of the deuill, wilt thou not deliuer vs from the hands of man? Thou that hast saued vs from hell, wilt thou not deliuer vs from the power of the world?</p>
            <pb n="248" facs="tcp:180936:149"/>
            <p> O eternall God, thou wilt doe it, and wilt not forsake vs, but hauing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised vs with measures, thou wilt make vs feele thy comforts, and wilt cause thy face to shine vpon vs in ioy and saluation; lest wee faint by infirmity, and be ouercome with the length and bitternesse of thy trials. For also (O Lord) thou hast so promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and thy promises are certaine, and thy Word more firme then heauen or earth. Thou hast promised by the mouth of thine own Sonne, that thou wilt not forsake vs, and that thou wilt be with vs alway, euen vnto the end of the world. Thou numbrest our haires, thou receiuest our sighes,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:180936:149"/>thou puttest our teares into thy bottle; he that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thy children, toucheth the apple of thine eye. Thou causest thy Angels to incampe round about them that feare thee; deare and precious is their death in thy sight.</p>
            <p>Doe thou therefore (O God) according to thy Word, and let the Angel of thy presence march before vs. Let thy protection be about vs as a wall of fire. Thou that asswagest the waues of the sea, and the commotions of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that holdest the hearts of Kings in thine hand as the running of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; stop the furie of the people, and giue vnto our King thoughts of peace;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:180936:150"/>remoue from him the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of violence, make fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the expectation of our enemies, that doe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die deuoure vs with hope; dissolue their counsels, thou that surprizest the wise in their wiles, that knowest the depthes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and piercest with thine eyes into the counsels of the sonne of perdition, whom thou wilt discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit with the Spirit of thy mouth, and wilt beate downe all power that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth it selfe against thine. And if our iniquities doe beare witnesse against vs, and make vs vnworthy to see so excellent a worke, doe it for thine owne sake. For if wee be vnworthy to be heard, thou art worthy
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:180936:150"/>to be glorified. Therefore thou wilt not permit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to triumph and reioyce at the dissipation of thy Church, and thy holy Name to bee blasphemed without punishment.</p>
            <p>Stirre vp therefore (O God) thy zeale, and the soundings of thy Fatherly affections; make bare the arme of thine holinesse, and let the ends of the earth see thy saluation. Remember thy ancient compassions, and thy couenant with thy people. Remember the bloud of thy children spilt in abundance, that cries for vengeance vnto thee from the earth.</p>
            <p>Wee confesse indeede, that wee haue neede to bee humbled, and that the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:180936:151"/>Church hath neede to bee repurged; and therefore thou takest thy fanne in thy hand, to thorowly purge thy floore, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest a winde of persecution to rise, that seemes to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie away the chaffe, and to chase the hypocrites. But also (O good God) amid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest this tribulation, the weake sinke vnder, and the good are oppressed, and haue part of the affliction, and idolatrie gathereth strength, and the night of ignorance thickeneth, and thy Name is blasphemed, and the doctrine of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is trodden vnder foote by thy aduersaries.</p>
            <p>Therefore wee beseech thee (O Father of mercie) that if thou wilt afflict vs,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:180936:151"/>let vs not fall into the hands of men; but let vs fall into thine hands; for thy compassions are great. For besides, men doe not hate vs, because wee haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thee, but because we maintaine thy quarrell, and that thy Name is of much note vpon vs. These bloud-suckers are thirsty after our bloud, not for to ease the patient, but to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their lust.</p>
            <p>Aboue all things (O God and Father) preserue vs thy Word, and afflict vs rather with any other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in this life, then to take away from vs this Light, seeing it is the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of thy fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, our priuiledge amongst all nations, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:180936:152"/>the way to attaine vnto thy Kingdome. Let our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be instructed therein, and be made heires of thy couenant alter vs, and let our dayes ended in thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, be followed with an age, wherein thy truth may shine, and the Kingdome of thy Son Iesus Christ may much increase and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. And continuing to vs the preaching of the Gospell in his purity, giue it efficacie in our hearts, and breake not in thine anger the staffe of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bread.</p>
            <p>Rather (O Lord) make that the feare of losing this light, prouoke vs to make good vse of it, and to redeeme the time, and aduance vs in the way,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:180936:152"/>while that wee haue the light. And that the euils wherewith thou doest vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site vs, may bee vnto vs wholesome remedies, and an instruction for our soules; that they serue to rowze vp our faith, and to draw from our hearts fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent Prayers. And that the deliuerance which it shall please thee to grant vs, may make vs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thy Fatherly loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, which shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company vs all the rest of our dayes, vntill that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken vs from this valley of misery, to put vs in possession of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wee may leaue after the Church in peace, the breaches of thy House re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and thy seruice
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:180936:153"/>purely established, to the glory of thy Name, and to the saluation of many soules, through thy Soone our Lord Iesus Christ. So be it.</p>

            <p> But in waiting for this happy Day, God leaues vs not without communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to entertaine vs in this expectation. This commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is done by two wayes; namely, by his Word, and by the inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Name: for by his Word hee speakes with vs, and by prayer wee speake with him.

            <p>There is nothing swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then this Dialogue, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to saluation then this communication.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:180936:154"/>prayer, wee should bee without hope, and without comfort.</p>
            <p>How much an important part of the seruice of God prayer is, it appeares mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, for that the holy Scripture, vnder the word of Inuocation and Prayer, comprehends often the whole seruice of God, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

            <p>Wee must well thinke, that prayer is a well-besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, holy, and a well ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary action; seeing that the Sonne of God hath been so frequent in it,

            <p>Wee must thinke that prayer is a great matter, and of importance, seeing that therewith euery faithfull man ought to finish his life, and render his soule vnto God in calling vpon him, and saying,
<note n="e" place="margin">

               <hi>Into thy hand I commit my spirit, for thou hast redeemed me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prayer is the hand, which wee stretch out vnto God,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:180936:155"/>to receiue his benefits: it is the key wherwith we open his treasure. It is it which vncouers our sores vnto God, which powres out our sighes, which speakes vnto God with an holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, which makes his rods to fall out of his hand, and diuerts his iudgements, and stirres vp his fatherly affections.</p>
            <p>Prayer is in families well gouerned, the ordinary sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and the Incense of the morning and euening, as it is said by the Psalmist,

               <hi>Let my prayer bee set forth before thee as Incense, and the lifting vp of my hands as the euening sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prayer is a spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, which the tyrants, how inuentiue and fraught
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:180936:156"/>with deuices soeuer their cruelty hath been, haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had the power to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; when they haue gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Martyrs, or haue cut their tongues out of their mouthes, their hearts spake vnto God, and their comfort in the deepe dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons was, to conuerse with God. For being chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp and shackled with Iron, their faith was not fettered. Let a Towne, where the Church is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged with armies, and all the passages taken by the enemy; then diuers propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions are set on foot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the meanes of her defence, or of her deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Reason will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound these difficulties,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:180936:156"/>and say, What meanes to escape, seeing we are inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on euery side by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy? What meanes to haue any helpe without, seeing that all the passages are taken? and whom could we send out to cause some succour to come, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake so dangerous a message? Thereupon Faith presents it selfe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth an expedient: I haue (quoth she) a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which wee call Prayer, who passeth without let, whom the enemies know not, who goeth to the gates of heauen; that way is not stopped, that Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is knowne in the Court of the King of heauen, it strikes boldly at the doore of his Closet, it prostrateth
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:180936:157"/>it selfe at his feet, it snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the thunderbolts out of his hands, it obtaineth a quicke and speedy succour from his Maiesty. And Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is at the right hand of God his Father, who accompanyeth it with his intercession.</p>
            <p>If euer we haue had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion (my brethren) to imploy this Messenger, it is in this so rough a time, and in the oppression of the Church of God. It is that which hath mooued vs to expound this passage of the Psalme, where <hi>Dauid</hi> in few words, but very signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, represents vnto vs the fruit &amp; profit of prayer, saying, <hi>Call vpon mee in the day of trouble, I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi>

                  <hi>that hee was a man subiect to the like passions as we are, and he prayed earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it might not raine, and it rained not on the earth by the space of three yeeres and sixe moneths. And

The Ancient Christian History makes mention of a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christian souldiers, which was called the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Legion, because that by prayer it caused a showre of raine to fall vpon the armie of the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> that was athirst, and caused thunder, lightening and tempests to fall on the army of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

Notwithstanding, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they ground their hope on their owne merits, I hold that their diffidence is iust, and that they haue reason to doubt of their saluation.

               <p>But if the things which ye demand, are things that concerne this present life, or not necessary to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we haue no promise of God that he will giue vs all that wee aske of him; but that onely hee will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake vs, and will not leaue vs Orphanes, and that hee will giue that which hee knoweth to bee expedient for our saluation: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these requests ought to bee conditionall, as that of the poore Leper, who said to Iesus Christ,

For wee aske of God to bee protected and preserued from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer danger, by such and such meanes: but God wall preserue vs by other means. We desire that the Church bee preserued by victories and battels, and by humane aydes, and wee expect from farre Countries some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary succour; but God will preserue vs by other meanes: hee will strike the enemies with astonishment, or hee will put diuision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, or he will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert their counsels. He will cause that the powers of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:180936:164"/>this world strike against some weake place, and break themselues in pieces, and stop at small obstacles, as a starting horse that starts and stops at a straw; or he will cause our suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be of good sauour; and amidst the persecution, he will giue efficacy to the doctrine of the Gospell; ye shall bee beaten downe, but afterwards raised vp.

               <p>Sometimes wee thinke that God hath not heard vs, because wee are impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and cannot waite for the time of deliuerance: but God will try you for a time; he seeth that wee are not enough puld vnder and humbled: He seeth that we are not low enough to bee lifted vp by miracle, and to cause his enemies to admire his vertue, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his worke in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation. Besides that, as the showres that fall drop by drop, doe soke the earth better, then those that come in a tempest, and boyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:180936:165"/>so the graces of God giuen little by little, doe much better fauour, and stirre vp our prayers, and exercise our faith. But when the time of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerance shall come, then you will say, I was too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient and too delicate, and too much rash in my iudgement. I see now that God hath heard me, and I acknowledge the fulfilling of that promise, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Item, wee thinke that God hath not heard vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee taketh not away the euils that presse vs; but hee giueth you force to beare them, hee increaseth your faith, hee hardeneth
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:180936:166"/>your courage; that ye may the easier beare that which you thinke to be vnsuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and will cause you to glory in the bearing of the Crosse of Christ, and with alacrity to goe forth after him
<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.13.</note> without the Campe, bearing his reproch.</p>
               <p>Such is (my brethren) the efficacy of prayer towards God. But it is also of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous efficacy towards our selues.</p>
               <p n="1">I. For first, that thought, that it is before God that we present our selues, and that it is to God we speake, ought to seaze vs with feare and reuerence, and make vs to quake, and our haires to stare with a religious horrour, by setting before our eyes, that the creature
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:180936:166"/>appeares before his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; dust and ashes, before the Soueraigne God, who dwelleth in the light which no man can approch vnto; a poore sinner, before a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraign Iustice. For as those that speake often vnto Kings, doe clothe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues more ciuilly, and haue a greater heed to that they say: So he that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth often to God, feeles himselfe bound to liue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly and ciuilly, and to looke neerer, not onely to his words, but also to his life.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Prayer will also draw you to eschew hypocrisie, because you appeare before God, who knoweth your hearts, who knoweth your requests before you present
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:180936:167"/>them to him, who is not contented with gestures, who pierceth with his eyes the darknes, and the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est cloke of hypocrisie.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Item, prayer will binde you to doe no wrong to any man, and to empty your hands of other mens goods, and of extortion, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, and oppression. For God saith by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Esa.</hi> 1.</note>
                  <hi>When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea when ye make many prayers, I will not heare; your hands are full of blood.</hi> Without it, we cannot follow the Apostles counsell, that willeth
<note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 8.8</note> vs to lift vp to God our hands pure, and holy; nor follow the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who saith, that
<note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Psa.</hi> 26.6.</note> he will wash his
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:180936:167"/>hands in innocency, before he compasseth the Altar of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. Besides, prayer will oblige you secretly to be almes-giuers, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the poore. For you will say in your selfe, In my prayer I aske an almes of God, will he giue it me, if I refuse it to my neighbour? Will he heare my voyce; if I stop mine eare at the cry of the afflicted? For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what God saith,
<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 21.13.</note>
                  <hi>Who so stoppeth his eares at the cry of the poore, hee also shall cry himselfe, but shall not bee heard.</hi> And in Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.7</note>
                  <hi>Blessed are the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for they shall obtaine mercy.</hi> Therefore wee are taught to aske in the plurall number our daily bread, as
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:180936:168"/>asking it for many; but the couetous reserues it to himselfe, and imparts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his brother.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Prayer also will tye you to hearken attentiuely to the Word of God: for you will say in your selfe, Will God heare my prayer, if I harken not to his Word? will he receiue my prayers, if I reiect his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements?</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Prayer also doth binde vs to the peace, and to concord with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. For this thought will come in your minds, Can I seeke for peace with God, while that I haue in my house warre and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord?
<note n="m" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.</note>
                  <hi>Lift vp holy hands without wrath and doubting;</hi> before thou
<note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23, 24.</note> bringest thy
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:180936:168"/>gift to the Altar, <hi>go thy way, first be reconciled to thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And truly where there are quarrels betweene man and wife, obserue it, and you shall finde that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill commeth, because they haue not bowed their knees together before God. For this one action would haue reunited them together, and haue quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their quarrels. Being well with God, they would haue beene well together. It is a thing that rarely happeneth among men, that two enemies present themselues before a Prince, to present to him toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one and the selfesame request.</p>
               <p>Nay which is more, in fashioning our prayers, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:180936:169"/>word that we speake, is a lesson to vs. For wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not desire of God, that his Name bee hallowed, and that his will be done, but that thereby wee are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to labour to glorifie his Name, and to subiect our selues to his will. In asking the bread which is ours, wee learne not to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet other folkes bread. In asking the forgiuing of our sinnes, wee bind our selues to the forgiuing of those, that haue trespassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs. In demanding not to bee led into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, wee learne to flie the temptations of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. So that in speaking to God, wee speake also to our selues; and so many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests are as many exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:180936:169"/>to the feare of God.</p>
               <p>And if prayer containes so many instructions to godlinesse, it brings no lesse comfort and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in our griefes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God saith to vs in this Psalme, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if to powre ones griefes in the bosome of a friend, giues some ease, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that friend can giue no remedie: How much more ease shall wee finde, when wee disburden our sorrowes on our God, seeing he is hee alone that both can, and will giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie? Whereupon <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, that
<note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 100</note>
                  <hi>Prayer was his refuge in aduersity,</hi> and the Apostle exhorteth the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,
<note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6.</note>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:180936:170"/>
                  <hi>to be carefull for nothing, but in euery thing by prayer and supplication with thankes-giuing, let your request be made knowne vnto God.</hi> Declaring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that prayer deliuereth the spirit from anguish and feare. The which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth plainely in the Psalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wee see the beginnings full of anguish and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie, but the end full of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance; as if in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of prayer his affaires were changed, or as if one had brought him the best newes. For by how much he did conferre with God, by so much hee felt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing, and his hope strengthened, and his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage increased.</p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:180936:170"/>
               <p> Besides that, prayer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioneth vs to patience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it enureth vs to looke towards God, and to turne our eyes frō men, who doe afflict vs, towards God, who doth imploy them; and not to be like the dogge strucken, that bites the sticke, or shappes at the stone.</p>
               <p>Yea, I say, that though wee should not obtaine of God the helpe we aske in affliction; notwithstanding, there is some contentment, to haue amiddest ones griefe, so sweet a diuersion as to speake with God. Such ought to bee the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of our solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse, and of our thoughts in the night. Being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to speake to men, who
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:180936:171"/>commonly speake of bad things, or of things to no purpose; let our occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be to entertaine our selues with God.</p>
               <p>Now although GOD commands vs to call vpon him in the day of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it followeth not that wee should not call vpon him also in prosperity. For there is alwayes matter of feare and of apprehension; we are alwayes exposed to the ambuscadoes of the world and the deuill. At all times wee haue inward maladies and infirmities; there is alwayes meanes to profit; alwayes occasion to aske forgiuenesse. Yea, also it is certaine, that prayer in prosperity hath, I know not what more seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:180936:171"/>and grace then it hath in affliction, because it is not drawne out by the force of griefe, but sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by loue and a filiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; it being no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, if we cry to God when he hath strucken vs.</p>
               <p>But because that in time of peace and prosperity, we are negligent in this dutie, God sends vs afflictions; He kindleth this heate by his contrarie, as when one kindleth lime, by powring water vpon it. Few fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent prayers mount vp to God during prosperity, and the spirits slackened with ease, doe conceiue but lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing thoughts, and prayers indited by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome. Griefe is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that eloquence, by
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:180936:172"/>the which God is perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. It draweth out fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent prayers, pushed forth by necessity. And that is true which men say, that prayer is more affectionate on the sea then on the land, because there the danger is continuall, and there is but two or three inches off betweene vs and death.</p>
               <p>Here I doubt not, but that too many amongst you, that haue the feare of God rooted in your hearts, this thought comes in your minde, and that you say in your selues, I know that as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, that
<note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.16.</note>
                  <hi>the effectuall feruent prayer of a righteous man auaileth much.</hi> But this is my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that in my prayer my minde wandereth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:180936:172"/>and my attention is misse-led, and there come other thoughts in my minde. How often being distracted, haue I renued my prayer, and am falne againe to the selfe-same straying! If I speake to a man, my thought is settled, and I thinke not elsewhere; why therefore in speaking to God, can I not haue the like attention? Surely my brethren, prayer is a taske, whereof the greater part of men doe acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues very slightly, and more by custome then by affection. How will wee haue God to heare vs, if we heare not our selues? And who is the Prince? yea, the man of meane condition, that would suffer one to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:180936:173"/>speake to him, thinking on another thing, or looking else-where? Those prayers by the which wee aske the forgiuenesse of our sins, are sins thēselues, of the which we must aske pardon; and must make other prayers to amend the former. It were necessary to say to many, Hold your peace, speake not to God, lest hee heare you, and you prouoke him to anger. Truly, God dealeth with vs very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if hee pardoneth our prayers, and layeth not to our charge our good workes.</p>
               <p>Now touching this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of staying ones thoughts in prayer, we will shew you first the causes thereof, and afterwards we
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:180936:173"/>will seeke the remedies.</p>
               <p>Foure things doe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to this euill. The first is, the naturall lightnesse of our spirits, that haue much adoe to stay themselues, and to keepe themselues a long time in one state. The second is, because the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine things are farre off from our selues, and from our apprehension. Now they are the sences that tye the attention. Is it not true, that you haue much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe to heare a Sermon, when you behold not him that speaketh? Therefore the Israelites sayd to <hi>Aaron,</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.1.</note>
                  <hi>Ʋp, make vs gods which shal goe before vs.</hi> The third cause is in our lusts, that is to say, that hee that makes his prayer, beares a hatred,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:180936:174"/>or hath a quarrell against some, or burnes with couetousnesse, or hath a burning ambition to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto some state or honour. Is there any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, if these longings so quick to moue themselues, and so rooted in, doe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our spirits, and doe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract our attention in prayer? The fourth cause is in the deuill, who if he seeth that you are tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a tale, or speaking of the affaires of this world, hath no intention, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you, to trouble you, because that it doth no preiudice to his Kingdome, and troubleth him not at all. But when he beholds a man bending his knees to pray to God, he saith in
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:180936:174"/>himselfe, This man goeth to his prayers, and in his prayer will aske that Gods Kingdome come; that is against mee, and against my Kingdome. Hee will pray that God deliuer him from euill; thats also against me, and to beate backe my temptations. Therefore let vs indeuour to cause some vaine thought to glide easily in his minde, and to distract his attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that euen his prayer it selfe may be a sinne, and that euen by prayer he may fall in the hands of the deuill.</p>
               <p>Whosoeuer knoweth mans frailty, knoweth that there is no body that is freed from this infirmity, and that the best are troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:180936:175"/>with it; and therefore those are mockers and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, who retyring themselues in the desarts, and leading an Hermites life, say that they giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly their mindes to prayer and to meditation. That is an abuse. Doubt not, but that in solitarines, and in that retired life, they burne with temptations, and that a presumptuous fretfulnesse makes them to frowne, because they haue no body with whom to compare but themselues, and that amiddest these hollow and shallow medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the deuill hath faire play.</p>
               <p>This euill cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied with certaine tricks which they imploy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:180936:175"/>their attention, namely, to say fiftie times the same Orisō in a barbarous or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue, in turning certaine beads, or in saying certaine Orisons which they call Iaculatories, as if they whisked or squirted prayers towards heauen: Or in composing certaine meditations with words puft vp with an extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant deuotion, as if they would prattle like Iayes to God.</p>
               <p>Therefore wee must come to the remedies of this euill, and know by what meanes we may stay our spirits in prayer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any idle digression. Of these remedies, there are some that are slight, and are rather counsels of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:180936:176"/>then of godlinesse, which notwithstanding are not to be despised; and others, stronger and more necessary.</p>
               <p>Therefore to begin with the lesser remedies: I say, that to keepe the spirit at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue, the gesture of the body composed to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the lifting vp of the hands and eyes, and the bowing of the knee doe serue. Besides, the voice: for the thought alone is the easier distracted. Item, the darkenesse, and the remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of all obiects that may ingender a diuersion. It is also a good counsell for those that cannot stay their spirits and thoughts, and that haue the carriage of their attention short, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:180936:176"/>themselues to short prayers, &amp; to returne to them the oftener.</p>
               <p>But these remedies are weake, in comparison of those that follow; whereof the one is, that seeing they are the burning lusts and desires which in awaking &amp; stirring themselues, come to trouble our spirits, and disorder our thoughts, and breake their flight when they are mounting vp to God; wee must labour to quiet them, and to strippe off our hatred and quarrels, to heale ones enuies, to bridle our couetousnesse, our choller, our wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for as long as these peruerse affections make a tumult within vs, they will trauerse our prayers, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:180936:177"/>disturbe our holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This is the true and soueraigne remedie. The remedies are, as when to heale an ague, one applieth on the wrist some hearbes, or some liquid medicine on the flankes and soft parts vnder the short ribbes. But this remedy which is to range the desires vnder the feare of God, is as it were a phlebotomy, or a purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which purgeth that which is within, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth the inward heate.</p>
               <p>Wee must adde to this remedy a wholesome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, which is, that when question is to pray to God, to stay a little, and not to bow so soone the knee, but to meditate a little in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe afore, on the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:180936:177"/>of him, before whom you goe to appeare; what are his eyes which pierce into our hearts; what hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his iudgements; what our miserie and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is, and the greatnesse of our sinnes; to the end ye neuer begin to pray, but being possessed with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious feare, and touched with reuerence. <hi>Dauid</hi> did thus, as it appeareth in the beginning of a Psalme,
<note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.1</note>
                  <hi>Truly God is good to Israel.</hi> Which is a broken speech, and a sequell of a long me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. It is no maruell therefore, if our mindes doe stray, and if their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is slacke, seeing that we goe to prayer heedlesly and without preparation.</p>
               <p>By this a man may know,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:180936:178"/>whether these remedies haue profited him; if after prayer done, the same thoughts doe continue in him a while, and if his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath much adoe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it selfe presently after, to any other action.</p>
               <p>But what care so euer you take, there will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes some defect. This perfection, to thinke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes on God without any distraction, is reserued for the life to come; where we shall haue but one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect that will fill our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, content all our desires, and where God shall be all in all.</p>

               <p>God hath created the world, &amp; men, &amp; Angels, to picture himself in his work, and to manifest the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his glory; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing merits so much to be represented, as that which is
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:180936:179"/>soueraignly faire. Now the light is the first of beauties, and God is Light, and the Father of lights.</p>
               <p>That God may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he hath sent his Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; for therby he hath declared his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, and his truth in fulfilling his promises; &amp; the hatred he beares against sin, in that he had rather strike his owne Sonne, then leaue sin vnpunished. He hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so thereby manifested his Wisedome, in finding a meanes to satisfie fully his Iustice, without preiudice to his Mercy. Hee hath shewed his Power, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vse of the flesh of a weake man, to ruine the empire of the diuell.</p>
               <p>To the end hee be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:180936:180"/>hee will send his Sonne to iudge the quicke and the dead, that at the sight of all creatures, his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse may bee knowne and acknowledged, the loue he beareth to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the Empire hee hath giuen to his Sonne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things: for it is written, <hi>As</hi>

               </p>
               <p>That he may be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he throwes down Kings, and ouerthrowes Empires in his anger, as God saith vnto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">

               <p> That he be glorified, he punisheth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> iniquity of his people, and of his seruants; as in the book of Numbers, hauing declared, that not one of that rebellious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly shall enter in the Land of promise; he addes,

                  <hi>will bee sanctified</hi> (saith he) <hi>in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because hee is iealous of his glory, hee will be alone serued, saying,
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Esa.</hi> 42.8</note>
                  <hi>My glory will I not giue to another, nor my praise to grauen Images.</hi> Not that God hath need to be glorified by men, or that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:180936:181"/>hee feeleth himselfe tickled as it were with our prayers; for before that man was created, he inioyed a soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne glory. And if he had need of glory, hee hath his Angels that glorifie him in another fashion: for our prayers doe debase his greatnesse, and our seruice is a kind of dis-seruice: our thankes-giuings are secret requests. The loue wee beare to God, is guided by our interest, and grounded on the loue of our selues; but hee will be glorified of vs, because there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that we should receiue vncessantly his goods, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making him some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement. Because it is also a meanes to draw new benefits, when we bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:180936:181"/>not the precedent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, either with obliuion, or ingratitude.</p>
               <p>Therefore God will haue vs sensible of the outrage done to his glory, and that in the affliction of the Church we lament, not the losse of our goods, not our banishment from our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, not the perill of our liues; but the abasing of his glory, the blaspheming of his holy Name, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishing of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the sonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> making intercession for the sinne of the people, doth not alleage the misery of that Nation, nor the ruine of so many persons; but (saith he) <hi>What wilt thou doe to thy great Name?</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.16.</note>
                  <hi>The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:180936:182"/>will say, Because the Lord was not able to bring this people vnto the Land which hee sware vnto them, therefore he hath slaine them in the Wildernesse.</hi> We haue also a singular exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this in the Prophecie of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> where God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth against the King <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> this iudgement,
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 36.23, 29.</note> that his house shal be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, and his dead body shal be cast out in the field, because that after the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of three or foure leaues of the Prophecie of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> hee suffered the Secretary to cut the leaues with the Penknife, and to cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, vntill all the roll was consumed in the fire, that he was not afraid,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:180936:182"/>nor rent his garments.</p>
               <p>To this purpose may bee applyed that which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalists say, that all naturall things haue two diuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; the one to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue themselues, the other to preserue the world; as the water glideth downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to preserue it selfe, for it seeketh after the place of her rest, but sometimes it mounteth vp on high to fill the empty place, because that the <hi>vacuum</hi> impugneth the lawes, and the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the vniuersall world; and the particular inclination ought to yeeld to the vniuersall Law, and the generall good. So the faithfull hath these two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; the one, to seeke for his rest and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:180936:183"/>the other, to procure the glory of God, which is a generall good, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all things ought to tend and serue it. When these two inclinations doe iustle together, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible, the preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our goods, and of our liues, ought to bee set apart and left behinde, that God may be glorified.</p>
               <p>But thereupon you will aske; But is it lawfull or possible to desire to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued and cut off eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the grace of God, that God may be glorified, and others saued? Not to hold you long in this point: I hold it, that that is neither lawfull, nor possible. For he should bee ill instructed, that should thinke that his
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:180936:183"/>damnation could be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and fit ransome to redeeme or saue others. It were an vniust thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, that a man who loueth God, and feareth him, should be punished for the guilty, and to will that God should commit an iniustice: but the strongest reason is, that if any, pusht on with the loue of God, desired to bee eternally damned, that God might bee glorified; hee should desire to bee an enemy vnto God, and to hate him eternally: now they are things incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and contradictory, that a man should bee set on by Gods loue, to desire to hate him; and that with louing him much, he desireth to be his enemie; for all the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:180936:184"/>hate God with a soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne hatred, and are his enemies for euer.</p>
               <p>Therefore when <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh thus to God,
<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32.</note>
                  <hi>Yet now if thou wilt, for giue their sinne; and if not, blot mee, I pray thee, out of thy Booke, which thou hast written.</hi> Hee speakes not of the Booke of life, nor of the roll of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Election, out of the which hee knew that none can be blotted; but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth to bee blotted out of the booke of the liuing; that is to say, to dye, rather then to see the destruction of the people. Of which booke of the living, the Psalmist speaketh,
<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.28.</note>
                  <hi>Let them bee blotted out of the booke of the liuing, and not be written with the righteous:</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:180936:184"/>that is to say, Cause them to dye, and extirpe them from off the face of the earth, that they may haue no more a place in Gods Church; for that in the two and thirtieth of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, where is mention made of a book, out of the which God blots men; God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe declareth, saying in the same place,
<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod</hi> 32.33.</note>
                  <hi>Whosoeuer hath sinned against mee, him will I blot out of my Booke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the same reasons, wee say that the Apostle Saint
<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom</hi> 9.3</note>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> may haue wished, that himselfe were an Anathema, and an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration among men, and separated from Christ as concerning the outward communion; but he could not, nor ought not to haue
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:180936:185"/>wished to bee a reprobate, and damned eternally. God forbid that any one of vs should haue such an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar zeale, as to will to bee damned, that God might bee glorified: in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth all the contentment of the faithfull, that hee knoweth that God will bee glorified in doing vs good.</p>
               <p>To conclude, yee are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (my brethren) to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God: this is the taske of the faithfull in this world.</p>
               <p>Now you must glorifie God, first, in words, not speaking of him without reuerence, and flying all hypocrisie and false-hood. For as <hi>Ioshuah</hi> said vnto <hi>Achan,</hi> that to
<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iosh.</hi>

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:180936:185"/>truth, is to giue glory vnto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Besides, you must glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God in trusting in his promises; for it is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and to assure ones selfe that God is true, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that
<note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20</note>
                  <hi>Abraham staggred not at the promise of God through vnbeliefe, but was strong in faith, giuing glory to God.</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.33.</note>
                  <hi>Whosoeuer hath receiued his testimony, hath set to his seale, that God is true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Item, you are to glorifie God by good workes, as Iesus Christ saith,
<note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16</note>
                  <hi>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ought to glorifie God in humbling your
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:180936:186"/>selues: for there is nothing that is so opposite to Gods glory, as mans glory; as Christ said to the Pharises, <hi>How</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.44</note>
                  <hi>can ye beleeue, which receiue honour one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and seeke not the honour that commeth from God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi> For this cause God cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downe the proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in glorifying themselues, they haue not giuen glory vnto God.</p>
               <p>Finally, yee must glorifie God in maintaining his cause, and being mooued with the zeale of his glory; in lieu that wee are quicke to stirre vp our selues for our owne interest, and wee are prickt and moued with a crosse word.</p>
               <p>How many persons doe you thinke there are like

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 17.16.</note> at Athens, whose spirit was stirred in him, when hee saw the City wholly giuen to Idolatry? Seing y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> if one cōmits adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, others laugh at it: If any one blaspheme, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers heare without being moued, as if Gods quarrell were not ours: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the truth is, that we are not onely guilty of the sinnes wee commit, but also of those that wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue in others.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, seeing that all things are made for Gods glory, yea euen

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:180936:187"/>but that ye glorifie God in some sort: for hee that will not glorifie him willingly, shall glorifie him perforce. If he bee not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by you, hee shall bee glorified in you; if yee are not the Heralds of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ye shall bee examples of his iustice.</p>
               <p>But wee hope better things of you. For God hath not called you and honoured you with his Couenant for nought, but that you may be saued. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour therefore to glorifie God by worke, and by word; in life, and in death; glorifie God in your life, that hee may glorifie you in your death.</p>
               <p>Yea euen in this life hee will make you feele the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:180936:187"/>effect of this promise, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble, I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie mee:</hi> And will manifest his glory in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance of his Church. There is yet Balme in Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead. There are yet some wholesome consolations and remedies with God. His compassions are not quenched: the Lord will not leaue his people, nor forsake his inheritance. For feeing the world hath been made for the Churches sake, it is certaine, that as Satan cannot ouerturne the world, so can hee not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the Church.
